Model structure configurations

The discriminators for attributes are implemented as convolutional neural networks Kim
(2014) that contain a convolutional layer on top of word vectors of a given sentence, followed
by a max-over-time pooling layer and then a fully-connected layer with softmax output
activation. A convolution operation is to apply a filter to word windows. Multiple filters
with varying window sizes are used to obtain multiple features. The sentiment discriminator
and the tense discriminator share the same network structure, where the convolutional layer
includes (window size, kernel numbers) of (3,100), (4,100), and (5,100).
The sentiment classifier “Std” used in section.4.2 has the same structure with the sentiment
discriminator.
