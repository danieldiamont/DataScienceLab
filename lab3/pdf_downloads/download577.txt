Distributed Mean Estimation with Limited Communication

A. Proof of Lemma 7
The equality follows from the symmetry in HD. To prove
the upper bound, observe that
⇥

E (Zimax )2 = Var (Zimax ) + (E [Zimax ]) .
Let D(j) be the j th diagonal entry of D. To bound the
first term observe that Zimax is a function of d independent
random variables D(1), D(2), . . . D(d). Changing D(j)
changes the Zimax by at most 2Xpid(j) . Hence, applying
Efron-Stein variance bound (Efron & Stein, 1981) yields

Note that Zi (k) = p1d j=1 D(j)H(k, j)Xi (j). Since the
D(j)’s are Radamacher random variables and |H(k, j)| =
1 for all k, j, the distributions of Zi (k) is same for all k.
Hence by Jensen’s inequality,
