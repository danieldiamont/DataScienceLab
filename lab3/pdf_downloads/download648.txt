A.1. Additional Details for Proof of Theorem 1
We have assumed that all paths from vi to v` go through
vj , and we wish to show that there exist functions F̃ and H̃
such that
vj = F (vi ) := F̃ (vi , vA )
v` = H(vj ) := H̃(vj , vB )
and all nodes in vA and vB are either not reachable from
vi or have no path to v` . Note that if a variable vk is not
reachable from vi , then the scalar
value v` may still depend
q
on vk , but the derivatives ddvvq` do not depend on vk , so it
i
is safe to treat vk as a fixed constant relative to the dual
number hv` , dvi iq . If vk has no path to v` , neither v` nor
q
the derivatives ddvvq` depend on vk .
i

The construction of F̃ is easy:
F̃ (vi , vA ) := fij (vi , v0:i

1)

The nodes v0:i 1 precede vi in the topological ordering,
and hence have no path from i.
To construct H̃, we reason about the partial computation
fj` (v0:` ) from vj to v` . Recall that this is defined recursively starting with '` (vk )k ` , and terminating whenever
a variable vp is reached for p  j. Consider any such variable vp that is reached by the calculation. Then vp must
satisfy p q for q > j (otherwise the recursion would not
reach vp ), and, furthermore, there must be a path from vq
to v` (otherwise the recursion does not reach vq ). In other
words, there is a path vp , vq , . . . , v` for q > j. However,
this implies that vp is not reachable from vi , otherwise we
would contradict the assumption that all paths from vp to
v` go through vj . Therefore, if we consider the subset of
variables vB ✓ v0:j 1 on which fj` depends, none of these
variables is reachable from vi . Therefore we can write:
H̃(vj , vB ) = fj` (vj , vB )
where we omit from fj` the arguments on which it does not
depend. This completes the argument.
