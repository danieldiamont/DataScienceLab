Abstract
In this paper we develop a new framework that captures the common landscape underlying the common nonconvex low-rank matrix problems including matrix sensing, matrix completion and robust PCA. In particular, we
show for all above problems (including asymmetric cases): 1) all local minima are also globally optimal; 2) no highorder saddle points exists. These results explain why simple algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent have
global converge, and efficiently optimize these non-convex objective functions in practice. Our framework connects
and simplifies the existing analyses on optimization landscapes for matrix sensing and symmetric matrix completion.
The framework naturally leads to new results for asymmetric matrix completion and robust PCA.

Introduction

Non-convex optimization is one of the most powerful tools in machine learning. Many popular approaches, from
traditional ones such as matrix factorization [Hotelling, 1933] to modern deep learning [Bengio, 2009] rely on optimizing non-convex functions. In practice, these functions are optimized using simple algorithms such as alternating
minimization or gradient descent. Why such simple algorithms work is still a mystery for many important problems.
One way to understand the success of non-convex optimization is to study the optimization landscape: for the
objective function, where are the possible locations of global optima, local optima and saddle points. Recently, a line
of works showed that several natural problems including tensor decomposition [Ge et al., 2015], dictionary learning
[Sun et al., 2015a], matrix sensing [Bhojanapalli et al., 2016, Park et al., 2016] and matrix completion [Ge et al., 2016]
have well-behaved optimization landscape: all local optima are also globally optimal. Combined with recent results
(e.g. Ge et al. [2015], Carmon et al. [2016], Agarwal et al. [2016], Jin et al. [2017]) that are guaranteed to find a local
minimum for many non-convex functions, such problems can be efficiently solved by basic optimization algorithms
such as stochastic gradient descent.
In this paper we focus on optimization problems that look for low rank matrices using partial or corrupted observations. Such problems are studied extensively [Fazel, 2002, Rennie and Srebro, 2005, Candès and Recht, 2009] and has
many applications in recommendation systems [Koren, 2009], see survey by Davenport and Romberg [2016]. These
optimization problems can be formalized as follows:
min

M∈Rd1 ×d2

f (M),

(1)

s.t. rank(M) = r.
Here M is an d1 × d2 matrix and f is a convex function of M. The non-convexity of this problem stems from the low
rank constraint. Several interesting problems, such as matrix sensing [Recht et al., 2010], matrix completion [Candès
and Recht, 2009] and robust PCA [Candès et al., 2011] can all be framed as optimization problems of this form(see
Section 3).

In practice, Burer and Monteiro [2003] heuristic is often used – replace M with an explicit low rank representation
M = UV> , where U ∈ Rd1 ×r and V ∈ Rd2 ×r . The new optimization problem becomes
min

U∈Rd1 ×r ,V∈Rd2 ×r

f (UV> ) + Q(U, V).

(2)

Here Q(U, V) is a (optional) regularizer. Despite the objective being non-convex, for all the problems mentioned
above, simple iterative updates from random or even arbitrary initial point find the optimal solution in practice. It is
then natural to ask: Can we characterize the similarities between the optimization landscape of these problems?
We show this is indeed possible:
Theorem 1 (informal). The objective function of matrix sensing, matrix completion and robust PCA have similar
optimization landscape. In particular, for all these problems, 1) all local minima are also globally optimal; 2) any
saddle point has at least one strictly negative eigenvalue in its Hessian.
More precise theorem statements appear in Section 3. Note that there were several cases (matrix sensing [Bhojanapalli et al., 2016, Park et al., 2016], symmetric matrix completion [Ge et al., 2016]) where similar results on the
optimization landscape were known. However the techniques in previous works are tailored to the specific problems
and hard to generalize. Our framework captures and simplifies all these previous results, and also gives new results on
asymmetric matrix completion and robust PCA.
The key observation in our analysis is that for matrix sensing, matrix completion, and robust PCA (when fixing
sparse estimate), function f (in Equation (1)) is a quadratic function over the matrix M. Hence the Hessian H of f
with respect to M is a constant. More importantly, the Hessian H in all above problems has similar properties (that it
approximately preserves norm, similar to the RIP properties used in matrix sensing [Recht et al., 2010]), which allows
their optimization landscapes to be characterized in a unified way. Specifically, our framework gives principled way
of defining a direction of improvement for all points that are not globally optimal.
Another crucial property of our framework is the interaction between the regularizer and the Hessian H. Intuitively,
the regularizer makes sure the solution is in a nice region B (e.g. set of incoherent matrices for matrix completion),
and only within B the Hessian has the norm preserving property. On the other hand, regularizer should not be too large
to severely distort the landscape. This interaction is crucial for matrix completion, and is also very useful in handling
noise and perturbations. In Section 4, we discuss ideas required to apply this framework to matrix sensing, matrix
completion and robust PCA.
Using this framework, we also give a way to reduce asymmetric matrix problems to symmetric PSD problems
(where the desired matrix is of the form UU> ). See Section 5 for more details.
In addition to the results of no spurious local minima, our framework also implies that any saddle point has at least
one strictly negative eigenvalue in its Hessian. Formally, we proved all above problems satisfy a robust version of
this claim — strict saddle property (see Definition 2), which is one of crucial sufficient conditions to admit efficient
optimization algorithms, and thus following corollary (see Section 6 for more details).
Corollary 2 (informal). For matrix sensing, matrix completion and robust PCA, simple local search algorithms can
find the desired low rank matrix UV> = M? from an arbitrary starting point in polynomial time with high probability.
For simplicity, we present most results in the noiseless setting, but our results can also be generalized to handle
noise. As an example, we show how to do this for matrix sensing in Section C.

Related Works

The landscape of low rank matrix problems have recently received a lot of attention. Ge et al. [2016] showed symmetric
matrix completion has no spurious local minimum. At the same time, Bhojanapalli et al. [2016] proved similar result
for symmetric matrix sensing. Park et al. [2016] extended the matrix sensing result to asymmetric case. All of these
works guarantee global convergence to the correct solution.
There has been a lot of work on the local convergence analysis for various algorithms and problems. For matrix
sensing or matrix completion, the works [Keshavan et al., 2010a,b, Hardt and Wootters, 2014, Hardt, 2014, Jain et al.,
2013, Chen and Wainwright, 2015, Sun and Luo, 2015, Zhao et al., 2015, Zheng and Lafferty, 2016, Tu et al., 2015]

showed that given a good enough initialization, many simple local search algorithms, including gradient descent and
alternating least squares, succeed. Particularly, several works (e.g. Sun and Luo [2015], Zheng and Lafferty [2016])
accomplished this by showing a geometric property which is very similar to strong convexity holds in the neighborhood
of optimal solution. For robust PCA, there are also many analysis for local convergence [Lin et al., 2010, Netrapalli
et al., 2014, Yi et al., 2016, Zhang et al., 2017].
Several works also try to unify the analysis for similar problems. Bhojanapalli et al. [2015] gave a framework
for local analysis for these low rank problems. Belkin et al. [2014] showed a framework of learning basis functions,
which generalizes tensor decompositions. Their techniques imply the optimization landscape for all such problems are
very similar. For problems looking for a symmetric PSD matrix, Li and Tang [2016] showed for objective similar to
(2) (but in the symmetric setting), restricted smoothness/strong convexity on the function f suffices for local analysis.
However, their framework does not address the interaction between regularizer and the function f , hence cannot be
directly applied to problems such as matrix completion or robust PCA.
Organization We will first introduce notations and basic optimality conditions in Section 2. Then Section 3 introduces the problems and our results. For simplicity, we present our framework for the symmetric case in Section 4, and
briefly discuss how to reduce asymmetric problem to symmetric problem in Section 5. We discuss how our geometric
result implies efficient algorithms in Section 6. We then show how our geometric results imply fast runtime of popular
local search algorithms in Section 6. For clean presentation, many proofs are deferred to appendix .

Preliminaries

In this section we introduce notations and basic optimality conditions.

2.1

Notations

We use bold letters for matrices and vectors. For a vector v we use kvk to denote its `2 norm. For a matrix M we
use kMk to denote its spectral norm, and kMkF toP
denote its Frobenius norm. For vectors we use hu, vi to denote
inner-product, and for matrices we use hM, Ni = i,j Mij Nij to denote the trace of MN> . We will always use
M? to denote the optimal low rank solution. Further, we use σ1? to denote its largest singular value, σr? to denote its
r-th singular value and κ? = σ1? /σr? be the condition number.
We use ∇f to denote the gradient and ∇2 f to denote its Hessian. Since function f can often be applied to both
M (as in (1)) and U, V (as in (2)), we use ∇f (M) to denote gradient with respect to M and ∇f (U, V) to denote
gradient with respect to U, V. Similar notation is used for Hessian. The Hessian ∇2 f (M) is a crucial object in our
framework. It can
interpreted
as a linear operator on matrices. This linear operator can be viewed as a d1 d2 × d1 d2
 be d+1

matrix (or d+1
×
matrix
in the symmetric case) that applies to the vectorized version of matrices. We use
2
2
the notation M : H : N to denote the quadratic form hM, H(N)i. Similarly, the Hessian of objective (2) is a linear
operator on a pair of matrices U, V, which we usually denote as ∇2 f (U, V).

2.2

Optimality Conditions

Local Optimality Suppose we are optimizing a function f (x) with no constraints on x. In order for a point x to be
a local minimum, it must satisfy the first and second order necessary conditions. That is, we must have ∇f (x) = 0
and ∇2 f (x)  0.
Definition 1 (Optimality Condition). Suppose x is a local minimum of f (x), then we have
∇2 f (x)  0.

∇f (x) = 0,

Intuitively, if one of these conditions is violated, then it is possible to find a direction that decreases the function value. Ge et al. [2015] characterized the following strict-saddle property, which is a quantitative version of the
optimality conditions, and can lead to efficient algorithms to find local minima.

3

Definition 2. We say function f (·) is (θ, γ, ζ)-strict saddle. That is, for any x, at least one of followings holds:
1. k∇f (x)k ≥ θ.
2. λmin (∇2 f (x)) ≤ −γ.
3. x is ζ-close to X ? – the set of local minima.
Intuitively, this definition says for any point x, it either violates one of the optimality conditions significantly (first
two cases), or is close to a local minima. Note that ζ and θ are often closely related. For a function with strict-saddle
property, it is possible to efficiently find a point near a local minimum.
Local vs. Global However, of course finding a local minimum is not sufficient in many case. In this paper we are
also going to prove that all local minima are also globally optimal, and they correspond to the desired solutions.

Low Rank Problems and Our Results

In this section we introduce matrix sensing, matrix completion and robust PCA. For each problem we give the results
obtained by our framework. The proof ideas are illustrated later in Sections 4 and 5.

3.1

Matrix Sensing

Matrix sensing [Recht et al., 2010] is a generalization of compressed sensing [Candes et al., 2006]. In the matrix
sensing problem, there is an unknown low rank matrix M? ∈ Rd1 ×d2 . We make linear observations on this matrix:
let A1 , A2 , ..., Am ∈ Rd1 ×d2 be m sensing matrices, the algorithm is given {Ai }’s and the corresponding bi =
hAi , M? i. The goal is now to find the unknown matrix M? . In order to find M? , we need to solve the following
nonconvex optimization problem
m

min
M∈Rd1 ×d2 ,rank(M)=r

f (M) =

1 X
(hM, Ai i − bi )2 .
2m i=1

We can transform this constraint problem to an unconstraint problem by expressing M as M = UV> where
U ∈ Rd1 ×r and V ∈ Rd2 ×r . We also need an additional regularizer (common for all asymmetric problems):
m

min
U,V

1 X
1
(hUV> , Ai i − bi )2 + kU> U − V> Vk2F .
2m i=1

(3)

The regularizer has been widely used in previous works [Zheng and Lafferty, 2016, Park et al., 2016]. In Section 5
we show how this regularizer can be viewed as a way to deal with the additional invariants in asymmetric case, and
reduce the asymmetric case to the symmetric case. A crucial concept in standard sensing literature is Restrict Isometry
Property (RIP), which is defined as follows:
Definition 3. A group of sensing matrices {A1 , .., Am } satisfies the (r, δ)-RIP condition, if for every matrix M of
rank at most r,
m
1 X
hAi , Mi2 ≤ (1 + δ)kMk2F .
(1 − δ)kMk2F ≤
m i=1

Intuitively, RIP says operator m
i=1 hAi , ·i approximately perserve norms for all low rank matrices. When
the sensing matrices are chosen to be i.i.d. matrices with independent Gaussian entries, if m ≥ c(d1 + d2 )r for
1
)-RIP condition [Candes and Plan, 2011]. Using our
large enough constant c, the sensing matrices satisfy the (2r, 20
framework we can show:

Theorem 3. When measurements {Ai } satisfy (2r, 20
)-RIP, for matrix sensing objective (3) we have 1) all local

minima satisfy UV = M 2) the function is (, Ω(σr ), O( σ? ))-strict saddle.
r

This in particular says 1) no spurious local minima existsl; 2) whenever at some point (U, V) so that the gradient is small and the Hessian does not have significant negative eigenvalue, then the distance to global optimal (see
Definition 6 and Definition 7) is guaranteed to be small. Such a point can be found efficiently (see Section 6).

3.2

Matrix Completion

Matrix completion is a popular technique in recommendation systems and collaborative filtering [Koren, 2009, Rennie
and Srebro, 2005]. In this problem, again we have an unknown low rank matrix M? . We observe each entry of the
matrix M? independently with probability p. Let Ω ⊂ [d1 ] × [d2 ] be a set of observed entries. For any matrix M,
we use MΩ to denote the matrix whose entries outside of Ω are set to 0. That is, [MΩ ]i,j = Mi,j if (i, j) ∈ Ω, and
[MΩ ]i,j = 0 otherwise. We further use kMkΩ to denote kMΩ kF . Matrix completion can be viewed as a special case
of matrix sensing, where the sensing matrices only have one nonzero entry. However such matrices do not satisfy the
RIP condition.
In order to solve matrix completion, we try to optimize the following:
min
M∈Rd1 ×d2 ,rank(M)=r

1
kM − M? k2Ω .
2p

A well-known problem in matrix completion is that when the true matrix M? is very sparse, then we are very
likely to observe only 0 entries, and has no chance to learn the other entries of M? . To avoid this case, previous works
have assumed following incoherence condition:
Definition 4. A rank r matrix M ∈ Rd1 ×d2 is µ-incoherent, if for the rank-r SVD XDY> of M, we have for all
i ∈ [d1 ], j ∈ [d2 ]
p

We assume the unknown optimal low rank matrix M? is µ-incoherent.
In the non-convex program, we try to make sure the decomposition UV> is also incoherent by adding a regularizer

Here λ1 , λ2 , α1 , α2 are parameters that we choose later, (x)+ = max{x, 0}. Using this regularizer, we can now
transform the objective function to the unconstraint form

3.3

Robust PCA

Robust PCA [Candès et al., 2011] is a generalization to the standard Principled Component Analysis. In Robust
PCA, we are given an observation matrix Mo , which is an true underlying matrix M? corrupted by a sparse noise S?
(Mo = M? + S? ). In some sense the goal is to decompose the matrix M into these two components. There are many
models on how many entries can be perturbed, and how they are distributed. In this paper we work in the setting where
M? is µ-incoherent, and the rows/columns of S? can have at most α-fraction non-zero entries.
5

In order to express robust PCA as an optimization problem, we need constraints on both M and S:
1
kM + S − Mo k2F .
2
s.t. rank(M) ≤ r, S is sparse.

min

(5)

There can be several ways to specify the sparsity of S. In this paper we restrict attention to the following set:


µrσ1?
d1 ×d2
Sα = S ∈ R
| S has at most α-fraction non-zero entries each column/row, and kSk∞ ≤ 2 √
.
d1 d2
Assuming the true sparse matrix S? is in Sα . Note that the infinite norm requirement on S? is without loss of
µrσ ?
generality, because by incoherence M? cannot have entries with absolute value more than √d d1 . Any entry larger
1 2
than that is obviously in the support of S? and can be truncated.
In objective function, we allow S to be γ times denser (in Sγα ) where γ is a parameter we choose later. Now the
constraint optimization problem can be tranformed to the unconstraint problem
1
min f (U, V) + kU> U − V> Vk2F ,
U,V
8
1
f (U, V) := min kUV> + S − Mo k2F .
S∈Sγα 2

(6)

Of course, we can also think of this as a joint minimization problem of U, V, S. However we choose to present it
this way in order to allow extension of the strict-saddle condition. Since f (U, V) is not twice-differetiable w.r.t U, V,
it does not admit Hessian matrix, so we use the following generalized version of strict-saddle
Definition 5. We say function f (·) is (θ, γ, ζ)-pseudo strict saddle if for any x, at least one of followings holds:
1. k∇f (x)k ≥ θ.
2. ∃gx (·) so that ∀y, gx (y) ≥ f (y); gx (x) = f (x); λmin (∇2 gx (x)) ≤ −γ.
3. x is ζ-close to X ? – the set of local minima.
Note that in this definition, the upperbound in 2 can be viewed as similar to the idea of subgradient. For functions
with non-differentiable points, subgradient is defined so that it still offers a lowerbound for the function. In our case
this is very similar – although Hessian is not defined, we can use a smooth function that upperbounds the current
function (upper-bound is required for minimization). In the case of robust PCA the upperbound is obtained by a fixed
S. Using this formalization we can prove
Theorem 5. There is an absolute constant c > 0, if γ > c, and γα · µr · (κ? )5 ≤ 1c holds, for objective function Eq.(6)
√
?
we have 1) all local minima satisfies UV> = M? ; 2) objective function is (, Ω(σr? ), O(  σ?κ ))-pseudo strict saddle
r
for polynomially small .

Framework for Symmetric Positive Definite Problems

In this section we describe our framework in the simpler setting where the desired matrix is positive semidefinite. In
particular, suppose the true matrix M? we are looking for can be written as M? = U? (U? )> where U? ∈ Rd×r . For
objective functions that is quadratic over M, we denote its Hessian as H and we can write the objective as
min
rank(M)=r

M∈Rd×d
sym ,

1
(M − M? ) : H : (M − M? ),
2

6

(7)

We call this objective function f (M). Via Burer-Monteiro factorization, the corresponding unconstraint optimization
problem, with regularization Q can be written as
1
(UU> − M? ) : H : (UU> − M? ) + Q(U).
(8)
min
U∈Rn×r 2
In this section, we also denote f (U) as objective function with respect to parameter U, abuse the notation of f (M)
previously defined over M.
Direction of Improvement The optimality condition (Definition 1) implies if the gradient is non-zero, or if we can
find a negative direction of the Hessian (that is a direction v, so that v> ∇2 f (x)v < 0), then the point is not a local
minimum. A common technique in characterizing the optimization landscape is therefore trying to explicitly find this
negative direction. We call this the direction of improvement. Different works [Bhojanapalli et al., 2016, Ge et al.,
2016] have chosen very different directions of improvement.
In our framework, we show it suffices to choose a single direction ∆ as the direction of improvement. Intuitively,
this direction should bring us close to the true solution U? from the current point U. Due to rotational symmetry
(U and UR behave the same for the objective if R is a rotation matrix), we need to carefully define the difference
between U and U? .
Definition 6. Given matrices U, U? ∈ Rd×r , define their difference ∆ = U − U? R, where R ∈ Rr×r is chosen as
R = argminZ> Z=ZZ> =I kU − U? Zk2F .
Note that this definition tries to “align” U and U? before taking their difference, and therefore is invariant under
rotations. In particular, this definition has the nice property that as long as M = UU> is close to M? = U? (U? )> ,
we have ∆ is small (we defer the proof to Appendix):
Lemma 6. Given matrices U, U? ∈ Rd×r , let M = UU> and M? = U? (U? )> , and let ∆ be defined as in
Definition 6, then we have k∆∆> k2F ≤ 2kM − M? k2F , and σr? k∆k2F ≤ 2(√12−1) kM − M? k2F .
Now we can state the main Lemma:
Lemma 7 (Main). For the objective (8), let ∆ be defined as in Definition 6 and M = UU> . Then, for any U ∈ Rd×r ,
we have
∆ : ∇2 f (U) : ∆ =∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(M − M? ) : H : (M − M? )
+ 4h∇f (U), ∆i + [∆ : ∇2 Q(U) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(U), ∆i]

(9)

To see why this lemma is useful, let us look at the simplest case where Q(U) = 0 and H is identity. In this case,
if gradient is zero, by Eq. (9)
∆ : ∇2 f (U) : ∆ = k∆∆k2F − 3kM − M? k2F
By Lemma 6 this is no more than −kM − M? k2F . Therefore, all stationary point with M 6= M∗ must be saddle
points, and we immediately conclude all local minimum satisfies UU> = M? !
Interaction with Regularizer For problems such as matrix completion, the Hessian H does not preserve the norm
for all low rank matrices. In these cases we need to use additional regularizer. In particular, conceptually we need the
following steps:
1. Show that the regularizer Q ensures for any U such that ∇f (U) = 0, U ∈ B for some set B.
2. Show that whenever U ∈ B, the Hessian operator H behaves similarly as identity: for some c > 0 we have:
∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(M − M? ) : H : (M − M? ) < −ck∆k2F .
3. Show that the regularizer does not contribute a large positive term to ∆ : ∇2 f (U) : ∆. This means we show an
upperbound for 4h∇f (U), ∆i + [∆ : ∇2 Q(U) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(U), ∆i].
Interestingly, these steps are not just useful for handling regularizers. Any deviation to the original model (such
as noise, or if the optimal matrix is not exactly low rank) can be viewed as an additional “regularizer” function Q(U)
and argued in the same framework. See e.g. Section C.

Matrix Sensing

Matrix sensing is the ideal setting for this framework. For symmetric matrix sensing, the objective function is

(10)

Recall that matrices {Ai : i = 1, 2, ..., m} are known sensing matrices, and bi = hAi , M? i is the result of i-th
observation. The intended solution is the unknown low rank matrix M? = U? (U? )> . For any low rank matrix M,
the Hessian operator satisfies

Therefore if the sensing matrices satisfy the RIP property (Definition 3), the Hessian operator is close to identity for
all low rank matrices! In the symmetric case there is no regularizer, so the landscape for symmetric matrix sensing
follows immediately from our main Lemma 7.

and second part of Lemma 6. This means if U is not close to U , that is, if k∆kF ≥ σ? , we have ∆ : ∇ f (U) :

σr? )-strict saddle property. Take  = 0, we know all stationary points with
k∆kF 6= 0 are saddle points. This means all local minima are global minima (satisfying UU> = M? ), which finishes
the proof.

4.2

Matrix Completion

For matrix completion, we need to ensure the incoherence condition (Definition 4). In order to do that, we add
a regularizer Q(U) that penalize the objective function when some row of U is too large. We choose the same
Pd
regularizer as Ge et al. [2016]: Q(U) = λ i=1 (kUi k − α)4+ . The objective is then
min

U∈Rd×r

Using our framework, we first need to show that the regularizer ensures all rows of U are small (step 1).

This is a slightly stronger version of Lemma 4.7 in Ge et al. [2016]. Next we show under this regularizer, we can
still select the direction ∆, and the first part of Equation (9) is significantly negative when ∆ is large (step 2):

2) the function is (, Ω(σr? ), O( σ? ))-strict saddle for polynomially small .

Notice that our proof is different from Ge et al. [2016], as we focus on the direction ∆ for both first and second
order conditions while they need to select different directions for the Hessian. The framework allowed us to get a
simpler proof, generalize to asymmetric case and also improved the dependencies on rank.

Robust PCA

In the robust PCA problem, for any given matrix M the objective function try to find the optimal sparse perturbation
S. In the symmetric PSD case, recall we observe Mo = M? + S? , we define the set of sparse matrices to be


µrσ1?
d×d
Sα = S ∈ R
| S has at most α-fraction non-zero entries each column/row, and kSk∞ ≤ 2
.
d
Note the projection onto set Sα be computed in polynomial time (using a max flow algorithm).
We assume S? ∈ Sα , the objective can be written as
min f (U),
U

where

f (U) := min

S∈Sγα

1
kUU> + S − Mo k2F .
2

(12)

Here γ is a slack parameter that we choose later.
Note that now the objective function f (U) is not quadratic, so we cannot use the framework directly. However, if
we fix S, then fS (U) := 21 kUU> + S − Mo k2F is a quadratic function with Hessian equal to identity. We can still
apply our framework to this function. In this case, since the Hessian is identity for all matrices, we can skip the first
step. The problem becomes a matrix factorization problem:
min

U∈Rd×r

1
kA − UU> k2F .
2

(13)

The difference here is that the matrix A (which is M? + S? − S) is not equal to M? and is in general not low rank.
We can use the framework to analyze this problem (and treat the residue A − M? as the “regularizer” Q(U)).
Lemma 13. Let A ∈ Rd×d be a symmetric PSD matrix, and matrix factorization objective to be:
f (U) = kUU> − Ak2F
where σr (A) ≥ 15σr+1 (A). then 1) all local minima satisfies UU> = Pr (A) (best rank-r approximation), 2)
objective is (, Ω(σr? ), O( σ? ))-strict saddle.
r

To deal with the case S not fixed (but as minimizer of Eq.(12)), we let U† (U† )> be the best rank r-approximation
of M? + S? − S. The next lemma shows when U is close to U† up to some rotation, U will actually be already close
to U? up to some rotation.
Lemma 14. There is an absolute constant c, assume γ > c, and γα · µr · (κ? )5 ≤ 1c . Let U† (U† )> be the best rank r†
approximation of M? + S? − S, where S is the minimizer
√ as in Eq.(12). Assume minR> R=RR> =I kU − U RkF ≤ .
?
Let ∆ be defined as in Definition 6, then k∆kF ≤ O( κ ) for polynomially small .
The proof of Lemma 14 is inspired by Yi et al. [2016] and uses the property of the optimally chosen sparse set S.
Combining these two lemmas we get our main result:
Theorem 15. There is an absolute constant c, if γ > c, and γα · µr · (κ? )5 ≤ 1c holds, for objective function Eq.(12)

we have 1) all local minima satisfies UU> = M? ; 2) objective function is (, Ω(σr? ), O(  σ?κ ))-pseudo strict saddle

Handling Asymmetric Matrices

In this section we show how to reduce problems on asymmetric matrices to problems on symmetric PSD matrices.
Let M? = U? V?> , and M = UV> , and objective function:
1
f (U, V) = 2(M − M? ) : H0 : (M − M? ) + kU> U − V> Vk2F + Q0 (U, V)
2
Note this is a scaled version of objectives introduced in Sec.3 (multiplied by 4), and scaling will not change the
property of local minima, global minima and saddle points.
We view the problem as if it is trying to find a (d1 + d2 ) × r matrix, whose first d1 rows are equal to U, and last
d2 rows are equal to V.

Definition 7. Suppose M? is the optimal solution, and its SVD is X? D? Y?> . Let U? = X? (D? ) 2 , V? = Y? (D? ) 2 ,
M = UV> is the current point, we reduce the problem into a symmetric case using following notations.
 
 ?

W=
,W =
, N = WW> , N? = W? W?>
(14)

V?
Further, ∆ is defined to be the difference between W and W? up to rotation as in Definition 6.
We will also transform the Hessian operators to operate on (d1 + d2 ) × r matrices. In particular, define Hessian
H1 , G such that for all W we have:
N : H1 : N = M : H0 : M
N : G : N = kU> U − V> Vk2F
Now, let Q(W) = Q(U, V), and we can rewrite the objective function f (W) as
1
[(N − N? ) : 4H1 : (N − N? ) + N : G : N] + Q(W)
2

(15)

We know H0 perserves the norm of low rank matrices M. To reduce asymmetric problems to symmetric problem,
intuitively, we also hope H0 to approximately preserve the norm of N. However this is impossible as by definition, H0
only acts on M, which is the off-diagonal blocks of N. We can expect N : H0 : N to be close to the norm of UV> ,
but for all matrices U, V with the same UV> , the matrix N can have very different norms. The easiest example is
to consider U = diag(1/, ) and V = diag(, 1/): while UV> = I no matter what  is, the norm of N is of order
1/2 and can change drastically. The regularizer is exactly there to handle this case: the Hessian G of the regularizer
will be related to the norm of the diagonal components, therefore allowing the full Hessian H = 4H1 + G to still be
approximately identity.
Now we can formalize the reduction as the following main Lemma:
10

Lemma 16. For the objective (15), let ∆, N, N? be defined as in Definition 7. Then, for any W ∈ R(d1 +d2 )×r , we
have
∆ : ∇2 f (W) : ∆ ≤∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(N − N? ) : H : (N − N? )
+ 4h∇f (W), ∆i + [∆ : ∇2 Q(W) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(W), ∆i]

(16)

where H = 4H1 + G. Further, if H0 satisfies M : H0 : M ∈ (1 ± δ)kMk2F for some matrix M = UV> , let W and
N be defined as in (14), then N : H : N ∈ (1 ± 2δ)kNk2F .
Intuitively, this lemma shows the same direction of improvement works as before, and the regularizer is exactly
what it requires to maintain the norm-preserving property of the Hessian.
Below we prove Theorem 3, which show for matrix sensing 1) all local minima satisfy M = M? ; 2) strict saddle
property is satisfied. Other proofs are deferred to appendix.

Proof of Theorem 3. In this case, M : H0 : M = m
i=1 hAi , Mi and regularization Q(W) = 0. Since H0 is
(2r, 1/20)-RIP, by Lemma 16, we have H = 4H1 + G satisfying (2r, 1/10)-RIP.
Similar to the symmetric case, for point W with small gradient satisfying k∇f (W)kF ≤ , by (2r, 1/10)-RIP
property of H (let δ = 1/10) we have
∆ : ∇2 f (U) : ∆ =∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(N − N? ) : H : (N − N? ) + 4h∇f (U), ∆i

The second last inequality is due to Lemma 6 that k∆∆> k2F ≤ 2kN − N? k2F , and last inequality is due to δ = 10

and second part of Lemma 6. This means if W is not close to W , that is, if k∆kF ≥ σ? , we have ∆ : ∇ f (W) :
r
∆ ≤ −0.2σr? k∆k2F . This proves (, 0.2σr? , 20
σr? )-strict saddle property. Take  = 0, we know all stationary points
with k∆kF 6= 0 are saddle points. This means all local minima satisfy WW> = N? , which in particular implies
UV> = M? because M? is a submatrix of N? .

Runtime

In this section we give the precise statement of Corollary 2: the runtime of algorithms implied by the geometric
properties we prove.
In order to translate the geometric result into runtime guarantees, many algorithms require additional smoothness
conditions. We say a function f (x) is l-smooth if for all x, y,
k∇f (y) − ∇f (x)k ≤ lky − xk.
This is a standard assumption in optimization. In order to avoid saddle points, say a function f (x) is ρ-Hessian
Lipschitz if for all x, y
k∇2 f (y) − ∇2 f (x)k ≤ ρky − xk.
We call an optimization algorithm saddle-avoiding if the algorithm is able to find a point with small gradient and
almost positive semidefinite Hessian.
Definition 8. A local search algorithm is called saddle-avoiding, if for a function f : Rd → R that is l-smooth and
√
ρ-Lipschitz Hessian, given a point x such that either k∇f (x)k ≥  or λmin (∇2 f (x)) ≤ − ρ, can find a point y in
poly(1/, d, l, ρ) iterations such that f (y) ≤ f (x) − δ where δ = poly(d, l, ρ, ).

11

As a immediate corollary, we know such algorithms can find a point x such that k∇f (x)k ≤  and λmin (∇2 f (x)) ≥
√
− ρ in poly(1/, d, l, ρ) iterations.
Existing results show many algorithms are saddle-avoiding, including cubic regularization [Nesterov and Polyak,
2006], stochastic gradient descent [Ge et al., 2015], trust-region algorithms [Sun et al., 2015b]. The most recent
algorithms [Jin et al., 2017, Carmon et al., 2016, Agarwal et al., 2016] are more efficient: in particular the number of
iterations only depend poly-logarithmic on dimension d. Now we are ready to formally state Corollary 2.
Corollary 17. Let R be the Frobenius norm of the initial points U0 , V0 , a saddle-avoiding local search algorithm can
find a point -close to global optimal for matrix sensing (10)(3), matrix completion (11)(4) in poly(R, 1/, d, σ1? , 1/σr? )
iterations. For robust PCA (12)(6), alternating between a saddle-avoiding local search algorithm and computing
optimal S ∈ Sγα will find a point -close to global optimal in poly(R, 1/, d, σ1? , 1/σr? ) iterations.
This corollary states the existence of simple local search algorithms which can efficiently optimizing non-convex
objectives of matrix sensing, matrix completion and robust PCA in polynomial time. The proof essentially follows
from the guarantees of the saddle-avoiding algorithm and the strict-saddle properties we prove. We will sketch the
proof in Section D.
Towards faster convergence For many low-rank matrices problems, in the neighborhood of local minima, objective
function satisfies conditions similar to strong convexity [Zheng and Lafferty, 2016, Bhojanapalli et al., 2016] (more
precisely, the (α, β)-regularity condition as Assumption A3.b in [Jin et al., 2017]). Jin et al. [2017] showed a principle
way of how to combine these strong local structures with saddle-avoiding algorithm to give global linear convergence.
Therefore, it is likely that some saddle-avoiding algorithms (such as perturbed gradient descent) can achieve linear
convergence for these problems.

Conclusions

In this paper we give a framework that explains the recent success in understanding optimization landscape for low
rank matrix problems. Our framework connects and simplifies the existing proofs, and generalizes to new settings
such as asymmetric matrix completion and robust PCA. The key observation is when the Hessian operator preserves
the norm of certain matrices, one can use the same directions of improvement to prove similar optimization landscape.
We show the regularizer 41 kU> U − V> Vk2F is exactly what it requires to maintain this norm preserving property
in the asymmetric case.Our analysis also allows the interaction between regularizer and Hessian to handle difficult
settings such as.
For low rank matrix problems, there are generalizations such as weighted matrix factorization[Li et al., 2016] and
1-bit matrix sensing[Davenport et al., 2014] where the Hessian operator may behave differently as the settings we can
analyze. How to characterize the optimization landscape in these settings is still an open problem.
In order to get general ways of understanding optimization landscapes for more generally, there are still many open
problems. In particular, how can we decide whether two problems are similar enough to share the same optimization
landscape? A minimum requirement is that the non-convex problem should have the same symmetry structure – the set
of equivalent global optimum should be the same. In this work, we show if the problems come from convex objective
functions with similar Hessian properties, then they have the same optimization landscape. We hope this serves as a
first step towards general tools for understanding optimization landscape for groups of problems.

Proofs for Symmetric Positive Definite Problems

In this section we provide the missing proofs for the symmetric matrix problems. First we prove Lemma 6 which
connects difference in the matrix U and the difference in the matrix M.
Lemma 6. Given matrices U, U? ∈ Rd×r , let M = UU> and M? = U? (U? )> , and let ∆ be defined as in
Definition 6, then we have k∆∆> k2F ≤ 2kM − M? k2F , and σr? k∆k2F ≤ 2(√12−1) kM − M? k2F .
Proof. Recall in Definition 6, ∆ = U − U? RU where
RU =

argmin
R> R=RR> =I

kU − U? Rk2F .

We first prove following claim, which will used in many places across this proof:
U> U? RU is a symmetric PSD matrix.

(17)

This because by expanding the Frobenius norm, and letting the SVD of U?> U be ADB> , we have:
argmin
R:RR> =R> R=I

=

kU − U? Rk2F =

argmin

−tr(U> U? R) =

argmin
R:RR> =R> R=I

−hU, U? Ri

R:RR> =R> R=I

argmin

−tr(DA> RB)

R:RR> =R> R=I

Since A, B, R ∈ Rr×r are all orthonormal matrix, we know A> RB is also orthonormal matrix. Moreover for any
orthonormal matrix T, we have:
X
X
tr(DT) =
Dii Tii ≤
Dii
i

i

The last inequality is because Dii is singular value thus non-negative, and T is orthonormal, thus Tii ≤ 1. This means
the maximum of tr(DT) is achieved when T = I, i.e., the minimum of −tr(DA> RB) is achieved when R = AB> .
Therefore, U> U? RU = BDA> AB> = BDB> is symmetric PSD matrix.
With Eq.(17), the remaining of proof directly follows from the results by substituting (U, Y) in Lemma 40 and 41
with (U? RU , U).
Now we are ready to prove the main lemma.
Lemma 7 (Main). For the objective (8), let ∆ be defined as in Definition 6 and M = UU> . Then, for any U ∈ Rd×r ,
we have
∆ : ∇2 f (U) : ∆ =∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(M − M? ) : H : (M − M? )
+ 4h∇f (U), ∆i + [∆ : ∇2 Q(U) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(U), ∆i]
Proof. Recall the objective function is:
f (U) =

1
(UU> − M? ) : H : (UU> − M? ) + Q(U)
2

and let M = UU> . Calculating gradient and Hessian, we have for any Z ∈ Rd×r :

Let Z = ∆ = U − U? R as in Definition 6 and note M − M? + ∆∆> = U∆> + ∆U> , then
∆ : ∇2 f (U) : ∆ =(U∆> + ∆U> ) : H : (U∆> + ∆U> ) + 2(M − M? ) : H : ∆∆> + ∆ : ∇2 Q(U) : ∆

+ [∆ : ∇2 Q(U) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(U), ∆i]
where in last line, we use the calculation of gradient ∇f (U) in Eq.18. This finishes the proof.
In the subsequent subsections we will prove the guarantees for matrix completion and robust PCA. The proof of
matrix sensing is already given in Section 4.

Proof. This Lemma follows from direct calculation using linear algebra and calculus.
In the first step of our framework, we hope to show that the regularizer forces the matrix U to not have large rows.
This is formalized and proved below (the Lemma is similar to Lemma 4.7 in Ge et al. [2016], but we get a stronger

∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(M − M? ) : H : (M − M? ) ≤ −0.3σr? k∆k2F
Proof. The key problem here is for the matrix ∆, it captures the difference between U and U? and could have norms
concentrate in very few columns. Note that when ∆ is not incoherent, Hessian will still perserve norm for matrices like
∆U> Lemma 35, but not necessarily perserve norm for matrices like ∆∆> . Therefore, we use different concentration
lemmas in different regimes (divided according to whether ∆ is small or large).
First by our choice of α, λ and Lemma 9, we know with 1 − 1/poly(d) probabilty, the maximum 2-norm of any

where the last step is by Lemma 6. This finishes the proof.

probability at least 1−1/poly(d), for matrix completion objective (11) we have 1) all local minima satisfy UU> = M?
2) the function is (, Ω(σr? ), O( σ? ))-strict saddle for polynomially small .

Proof. By Lemma 10, we know
∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(M − M? ) : H : (M − M? ) ≤ −0.3σr? k∆k2F
On the other hand, by Lemma 11, we have the regularization term:
[∆ : ∇2 Q(U) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(U), ∆i] ≤ 0.1σr? k∆k2F
This means for point U with small gradient satisfying k∇f (U)kF ≤ :

That is, if U is close to U? (i.e. if k∆kF ≥ 40
σr? ), we have ∆ : ∇ f (U) : ∆ ≤ −0.1σr k∆kF . This proves
(, 0.1σr? , 40
σr? )-strict saddle property. Take  = 0, we know all stationary points with k∆kF 6= 0 are saddle points.
This means all local minima are global minima (satisfying UU> = M? ), which finishes the proof.

A.2

Robust PCA

For robust PCA, the first crucial step is to analyze the matrix factorization problem when target matrix is not necessarily
low rank (that happens if we fix S).
Lemma 13. Let A ∈ Rd×d be a symmetric PSD matrix, and matrix factorization objective to be:
f (U) = kUU> − Ak2F
where σr (A) ≥ 15σr+1 (A). then 1) all local minima satisfies UU> = Pr (A) (best rank-r approximation), 2)
objective is (, Ω(σr? ), O( σ? ))-strict saddle.
r

?

Proof. Denote M = Pr (A) to be the top r part and S = A − M? to be the remaining part. In our framework, we
can also view this remaining part as regularization term. That is:
M : H : M = kMk2F

and

1
Q(U) = hM? − UU> , Si + kSk2F
2

Moreover, since the eigenspace of M? is perpendicular to S, we have:
[∆ : ∇2 Q(U) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(U), ∆i] = −2h∆∆> , Si + 4hU∆ + ∆U, Si = 6hUU> , Si ≤ 6kSkk∆k2F
The last step is because suppose XDX> is the SVD of S, then hUU> , Si ≤ kDkkX> Uk2F = kDkkX> (U − U? )k2F ≤
kSkk∆k2F .
21

Therefore, for point U with small gradient satisfying k∇f (U)kF ≤ :
∆ : ∇2 f (U) : ∆ =∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(M − M? ) : H : (M − M? ) + 4h∇f (U), ∆i

≤ − kM − M? k2F + 4k∆kF + 6kSkk∆k2F ≤ −0.4σr? k∆k2F + 4k∆kF
The second last inequality is due to Lemma 40 that k∆∆> k2F ≤ 2kM − M? k2F , and last inequality is due to Lemma
2
41 and kSk = λr+1 (A) ≤ λr (A)/15. This means if U is close to U? , that is, if k∆kF ≥ 20
σr? , we have ∆ : ∇ f (U) :

∆ ≤ −0.2σr k∆kF . This proves (, 0.2σr , σ? )-strict saddle property. Take  = 0, we know all stationary points with
r
k∆kF 6= 0 are saddle points. This means all local minima are global minima (satisfying UU> = M? ), which finishes
the proof.
Next we need to show that if U is close to the best rank-r approximation of M? + S? − S, then it also must be
close to the true U? . The proofs of this lemma for symmetric robust PCA is almost directly followed by the arguments
for asymmetric versions. Therefore we do not repeat the proofs here.
Lemma 14. There is an absolute constant c, assume γ > c, and γα · µr · (κ? )5 ≤ 1c . Let U† (U† )> be the best rank r†
approximation of M? + S? − S, where S is the minimizer

?
Let ∆ be defined as in Definition 6, then k∆kF ≤ O( κ ) for polynomially small .
Proof. The proof follows from the same argument as the proof of Lemma 24.
Combining these two lemmas, it is not hard to show to main result for Robust PCA.

Consider point U with small gradient satisfying k∇f (U)kF ≤ . Let
SU = argmin kUU> + S − M? − S? k2F
S∈Sγα

and function fU (Ũ) = kŨŨ> + SU − M? − S? k2F , then, we know for all Ũ, we have fU (Ũ) ≥ f (Ũ) and
fU (U) = f (U). Since fU (Ũ) is matrix factorization objective where by Lemma 28:

Proofs for Asymmetric Problems

In this section we give proofs for the asymmetric settings. In particular, we first prove the main lemma, which gives
the crucial reduction from asymmetric case to symmetric case.
Lemma 16. For the objective (15), let ∆, N be defined as in Definition 7. Then, for any W ∈ R(d1 +d2 )×r , we have
∆ : ∇2 f (W) : ∆ ≤∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(N − N? ) : H : (N − N? )
+ 4h∇f (W), ∆i + [∆ : ∇2 Q(W) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(W), ∆i]
Further, if H0 satisfies M : H0 : M ∈ (1 ± δ)kMk2F for some matrix M = UV> , let W and N be defined as in
(14), then N : H : N ∈ (1 ± 2δ)kNk2F .
Proof. Recall the objective function is (N = WW> ):
f (W) =

1
[(N − N? ) : 4H1 : (N − N? ) + N : G : N] + Q(W)
2

Calculating gradient and Hessian, we have for any Z ∈ Rd×r :
h∇f (W), Zi =(N − N? ) : 4H1 : (WZ> + ZW> ) + N : G : (WZ> + ZW> ) + h∇Q(W), Zi
Z : ∇2 f (W) : Z =(WZ> + ZW> ) : (4H1 + G) : (WZ> + ZW> ) + 2(N − N? ) : 4H1 : ZZ>
+ 2N : G : ∆∆> + Z : ∇2 Q(W) : Z
Let Z = ∆ = W − W? R as in Definition 7, and note N − N? + ∆∆> = W∆> + ∆W> and N? : G : N? = N? :
G : W? W> = 0 due to U?> U? = V?> V? . Let H = 4H1 + G, then
h∇f (W), ∆i =(N − N? ) : H : (W∆> + ∆W> ) + N? : G : (W∆> + ∆W> ) + h∇Q(W), ∆i
=(N − N? ) : H : (W∆> + ∆W> ) + 2N? : G : N + h∇Q(W), ∆i

(21)

Where the last equality is use the fact N? : G : W? W> = N? : G : WW?> = 0. For Hessian along ∆ direction:
∆ : ∇2 f (W) : ∆ =(W∆> + ∆W> ) : H : (W∆> + ∆W> ) + 2(N − N? ) : 4H1 : ∆∆>
+ 2N : G : ∆∆> + ∆ : ∇2 Q(W) : ∆

(22)

For first term of Eq.(22): since ∆∆> + (N − N? ) = W∆> + ∆W> and (a + b)2 = a2 + 2b(a + b) − b2 and Eq.(21),
we have:
(W∆> + ∆W> ) : H : (W∆> + ∆W> )
=∆∆> : H : ∆∆> + 2(N − N? ) : H : (W∆> + ∆W> ) − (N − N? ) : H : (N − N? )
=∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − (N − N? ) : H : (N − N? ) + 2h∇f (W), ∆i − 4N? : G : N − 2h∇Q(W), ∆i
For the sum of second and third terms of Eq.(22):
2(N − N? ) : 4H1 : ∆∆> + 2N : G : ∆∆>
=2(N − N? ) : H : ∆∆> + 2N? : G : N
= − 2(N − N? ) : H : (N − N? ) + 2(N − N? ) : H : (W∆> + ∆W> ) + 2N? : G : N
= − 2(N − N? ) : H : (N − N? ) + 2h∇f (W), ∆i − 2N? : G : N − 2h∇Q(W), ∆i
In sum, we have:
∆ : ∇2 f (W) : ∆ =∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(N − N? ) : H : (N − N? ) − 6N? : G : N
+ 4h∇f (W), ∆i + [∆ : ∇2 Q(W) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(W), ∆i]
23

cleary the third term is always non-positive. this gives:
∆ : ∇2 f (W) : ∆ ≤∆∆> : H : ∆∆> − 3(N − N? ) : H : (N − N? ) + 4h∇f (W), ∆i
+ [∆ : ∇2 Q(W) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(W), ∆i]
The remaining claims directly follows from Lemma 19.

We proceed in three steps analogous to the symmetric setting. First we show the regularizer again implies rows of
U, V cannot be too large (similar to Lemma 9).

where the last step is by Lemma 6. This finishes the proof.
26

Finally we bound the contribution from regularizer (analogous to Lemma 11). In fact since our regularizers are
very similar we can directly use the same calculation.
Lemma 22. By choosing α12 = Θ(

µrσ1?
d1 ),

α12 = Θ(

µrσ1?
d1 ),

λ1 α12 ≤ O(σr? ) and λ2 α22 ≤ O(σr? ), we have:

1
[∆ : ∇2 Q(W) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(W), ∆i] ≤ 0.1σr? k∆k2F
4
Proof. By same calculation as the proof of Lemma 11, we can show:
1
[∆U : ∇2 Q1 (U) : ∆U − 4h∇Q1 (U), ∆U i] ≤ 0.1σr? k∆U k2F
4
1
[∆V : ∇2 Q2 (V) : ∆V − 4h∇Q2 (V), ∆V i] ≤ 0.1σr? k∆V k2F
4
Given Q(W) = Q1 (U) + Q2 (V), the lemma follows.
Combining three lemmas, our main result for asymmetric matrix completion easily follows.

r

Proof. Same argument as the proof Theorem 12 by combining Lemma 20, 21 and 22.

B.2

Robust PCA

For robust PCA, again a crucial step is to analyze the matrix factorization problem. We prove the following Lemma
(analogous to Lemma 13).
Lemma 23. Let matrix factorization objective to be (U ∈ Rd1 ×r , V ∈ Rd2 ×r ):
1
f (W) = 2kUV> − Ak2F + kU> U − V> Vk2F
2
and σr (A) ≥ 30σr+1 (A). then 1) all local minima satisfies UV> is the top-r SVD of matrix A; 2) objective is
(, 0.2σr? , 20
σ ? )-strict saddle
r

Proof. Denote M? = Pr (A) to be the top-r SVD of A, and S = A − M? to be the remaining part. In our framework,
we can also view this remaining part as regularization term. That is:
M : H0 : M = kMk2F

and

Q(W) = 4hM? − UV> , Si + 2kSk2F

Moreover, since the eigenspace of M? is perpendicular to S, we have:
>
>
[∆ : ∇2 Q(W) : ∆ − 4h∇Q(W), ∆i] = − 8h∆U ∆>
V , Si + 16hU∆V + ∆U V , Si

=24hUV> , Si ≤ 24kSkk∆U kF k∆V kF ≤ 12kSkk∆k2F
The last step is because suppose XDY> is the SVD of S, then
hUV> , Si ≤ kDkkX> UkF kY> VkF = kDkkX> (U − U? )kF kY> (V − V? )kF ≤ kSkk∆U kF k∆V kF
Using Lemma 19, the remaining argument is the same as Lemma 13.
Next we prove when W is close to the optimal solution of the matrix factorization problem, it must also be close
to the true W? . The proof of this lemma uses several crucial properties in choice of S and the sparse set Sγα . This will
require several supporting lemmas which we prove after the main theorem. Our proof is inspired by Yi et al. [2016].

Similarly, we also have kM − M? k2Ω? ≤ 0.04σr? k∆k2F Clearly, we have kM − M? kF ≤ kN − N? kF . By Lemma 41,
we also have σr? k∆k2F ≤ 2(√12−1) kN − N? k2F . Given our choice of γ, this gives:

fW (W̃) ≥ f (W̃) and fW (W) = f (W). Since fW (W̃) is matrix factorization objective where by Lemma 28:

B.3

Supporting Lemmas for robust PCA

In the proof of Lemma 24, we used several supporting lemmas. We now prove them one by one. The first is a classical
result from matrix perturbations.
Lemma 25. Let M† be the top-r SVD of matrix M? + S ∈ Rd1 ×d2 where M? is rank r. Then we have:
kM† − M? kF ≤ 2kSkF
Proof. By triangle inequality:
kM? − M† kF ≤kM? + S − M† kF + kSkF
For the second term, by the fact M? is rank r, the definition of M† and Weyl’s inequality:
?

This finishes the proof.
Next we show how to bound the norm of matrix M − M? restricted to a sparse set Ω.

Lemma 26. Let M? = U? V?> are both µ-incoherent matrix, M = UV> satisfies maxi ke>

and Ω has at most α fraction of non-zero entries in each row/column. Then:
kM − M? k2Ω ≤ 4αµrkM? k(k∆U k2F + k∆V k2F )

where ∆U = U − U? , ∆V = V − V? .

Next, we show for any fixed sparse estimator S, if M? is incoherent, the top-r SVD of M? + S? − S will also be
incoherent. Thus, sparse matrix will not interfere incoherence in this sense.
Lemma 27. For any S ∈ Sγα , let M† be the top-r SVD of M? + S? − S, and the SVD of M† to be XDY> , if

Therefore, for any i ∈ [d], because S, S? has at most γα fraction non-zero entries in each row, and kS? k∞ ≤ 2 √d d1

Then, we show a crucial property of the optimal S ∈ Sγα :
Lemma 29. For any matrix A, let Sopt = argminS∈Sγα kA − Sk2F , and Ω be the support of S, then for any (i, j) ∈
[d1 ] × [d2 ] − Ω, we have:
(γαd )
(γαd )
|A(i,j) | ≤ |A(i,·) 1 | + |A(·,j) 2 |
(k)

(k)

where A(i,·) is the k-th largest element (in terms of absolute value) in i-th row of A and A(·,j) the k-th largest element
(in terms of absolute value) in j-th column of A.
Proof. Assume the contradiction that in optimal solution S there is a pair (i, j) ∈ [d1 ] × [d2 ] − Ω such that
(γαd1 )

|A(i,j) | > |A(i,·)

(γαd )

| + |A(·,j) 2 |

If row i has exactly γαd1 elements in Ω, let e1 = (i, j 0 ) be the smallest entry in row i (j 0 = arg minz:(i,z)∈Ω |A(i,z) |),
(γαd )

clearly A(i,j 0 ) ≤ A(i,·) 1 . If row i has fewer elements we just let e1 be empty. Similarly, if column j has exactly
γαd2 elements in Ω, let e2 = (i0 , j) be the smallest entry in the column (i0 = arg minz:(z,j)∈Ω |A(z,j) |), we also have
(γαd )

A(i0 ,j) ≤ A(·,j) 2 .
Now we can add (i, j) to Ω, and remove e1 and e2 . Call the resulting matrix S0 . This clearly does not violate
µrσ ?
the support constraint. Let q(x) = (x − max{0, x − 2 √d d1 })2 , this function is monotone for x > 0 and satisfies
1 2
q(x) + q(y) ≤ q(x + y). Now the difference we get from changing S to S0 is
kA − S0 k2F = kA − Sk2F − q(|A(i,j) |) + q(|Ae1 |) + q(|Ae2 |) < kA − Sk2F .
This contradicts with the fact that S was the optimal. Therefore there cannot be such an entry (i, j).
Finally, by using above lemmas, we can show how to bound the difference between optimal S and true sparse
matrix S? , which is a key step in Lemma 24.
Lemma 30. For any matrix A ∈ Rd1 ×d2 , let S? ∈ Sα and
Sopt = argmin kS − S? + Ak2F
S∈Sγα

Let Ω be the support of Sopt and Ω? be the support of S? , we will have:
kSopt − S? k2F ≤ 2kAk2Ω? ∪Ω +

kAk2F
γ−1

Proof. Clearly, the support of Sopt − S? must be a subset of Ω ∪ Ω? . Therefore, we have:
kSopt − S? k2F = kSopt − S? k2Ω + kSopt − S? k2Ω? −Ω

31

By assumption we know S? ∈ Sα thus kS? k∞ ≤ 2 √d

this gives |(Sopt − S? )(i,j) | ≤ |(A)(i,j) | thus:

kSopt − S? k2Ω ≤ kAk2Ω
For the second term, by triangle inequality, we have:
kSopt − S? kΩ? −Ω = kS? kΩ? −Ω ≤ kS? − AkΩ? −Ω + kAkΩ? −Ω
By Lemma 29, we have for any (i, j) ∈ Ω? − Ω:

Matrix Sensing with Noise

In this section we demonstrate how to handle noise using our framework. The key idea here is to consider the noise as
a perturbation to the original objective function and use Q(U) (originally the regularizer) to also capture the noise.

C.1

Symmetric case

Here, we assume in each observation, instead of observing the exact value bi = hAi , M? i we observe bi = hAi , M? i+
ni . Here ni is i.i.d N (0, σ 2 ). Recall the objective function in Section 4, we now have:
m

f (M) =

1 X
(hM − M? , Ai i + ni )2
m i=1

(26)

Define Q(U) = f (UU> ) − 21 (UU> − M? ) : H : (UU> − M? ) to be the perturbation, we can write out the
non-convex objective
1
min
(UU> − M? ) : H : (UU> − M? ) + Q(U).
(27)
d×r

U∈R
Now we can use the same framework. Again, since for matrix sensing we have the RIP property, we do not need
the first step to restrict to special low rank matrices. Using our approach we can get

Asymmetric case

For the asymmetric case, the proof is again almost identical. We use the same noise model where the observation

Again by bounding the gradient and Hessian for Q(W) we get the following

Proof Sketch for Running Time

In this section we sketch the proof for Corollary 17.
Corollary 17. Let R be the Frobenius norm of the initial points U0 , V0 , a saddle-avoiding local search algorithm can
find a point -close to global optimal for matrix sensing (10)(3), matrix completion (11)(4) in poly(R, 1/, d, σ1? , 1/σr? )
iterations. For robust PCA (12)(6), alternating between a saddle-avoiding local search algorithm and computing
optimal S ∈ Sγα will find a point -close to global optimal in poly(R, 1/, d, σ1? , 1/σr? ) iterations.
The full proof require some additional analysis depending on the particular algorithm used, and is highly dependent
on the detailed proofs of the guarantees, so we only give a proof sketch here.
Our geometric results show that for small enough 0 , the objective functions are (0 , γ, C0 ) strict-saddle where γ
and C may depend polynomially on (σ1? , σr? ). Choose 0 = /C, we know for each point, either it has a gradient at
least 0 , or the Hessian has an eigenvalue smaller than −γ, or k∆kF ≤ . In the first two cases, by Definition 8 we
know saddle-avoiding algorithm can decrease the function value by an inverse polynomial factor in polynomial time.
By the radius of the initial solution, the difference in function value between the original solution and optimal solution
is bounded by poly(R, σ1? , d), so after a polynomial number of iterations we can no longer decrease function value and
must be in the third case (where k∆kF ≤ ).
Smoothness and Hessian Lipschitz The objective funcitons we work with are mostly polynomials thus both smooth
and Hessian Lipschitz. The regularizers we add also tried to make sure at least both smoothness and Hessians Lipschitz
are satisfied. However, the objective functions are still not very smooth or Hessian-Lipschitz especially in the region
when then the norm of (U, V) is very large. This is because the polynomials are of degree more than 2 and in general
the smoothness and Hessian-Lipschitzness parameters (l, ρ) depend on the norm of the current point (U, V). It is not
hard to show that when the solution is constrained into a ball of radius R, the parameters l, ρ are all poly(R). Therefore
to complete the proof we need to show that the intermediate steps of the algorithms cannot escape from a large ball.
In fact, for all the known algorithms, on our objective functions the following is true
Lemma 33. For current saddle avoiding algorithms (including cubic regularization [Nesterov and Polyak, 2006],
perturbed gradient descent [Jin et al., 2017] ) There exists a radius R that is polynomial in problem parameters, such
that if initially kUkF + kVkF = R0 ≤ R, then with high probability all the iterations will have kUkF + kVkF ≤ 2R.
The proof of this lemma is mostly calculations (and observing the fact that when U, V are both very large, the
gradient will essentially point to 0), as an example this is done for matrix factorization in [Jin et al., 2017]. We omit
the proof in this paper.
Note that our geometric results for matrix sensing does not depend on the dimension. If we can prove a bound on
R that is independent of the dimension d, by recent result in [Jin et al., 2017], we can get algorithms whose number of
iterations depend only on log d for matrix sensing.

35

Handling Robust-PCA For robust PCA, the objective function is only pseudo strict-saddle (see Definition 5).
In order to turn the geometric property to an algorithm, the first observation is that the optimal S for U, V can be
found in polynomial time: The problem of finding the optimal S can be formulated as a weighted bipartite matching
problem where one part corresponds to the rows, the other part corresponds to the columns, and the value corresponds
to the improvement in objective function when we add (i, j) into the support. According to the definition of S, each
row/column can be matched a limited number of times. This problem can be solved by converting it to max-flow, and
standard analysis shows that there exists an optimal integral solution.
Next we view the robust PCA objective function of form f (U, V) = minS∈Sγα g(U, V; S). We show that
alternating between saddle-avoiding local search and optimizing S over Sγα will allow us to get the desired guarantee.
For a point U, V, if it is not close enough to the global optimal solution, we can fix the optimal S for U, V and
study g(U, V; S). First, we know for this optimal choice of S, the gradient of g(U, V; S) over (U, V) is the same
as gradient of f (U, V). Then, by Theorem 15 / Theorem 5, we know either the gradient of g(U, V; S) is large
or the Hessian of g(U, V; S) has an eigenvalue at most −Ω(σr? ). By the guarantee of saddle-avoiding algorithms in
polynomial number of steps we can find U0 , V0 such that the objective function g(U0 , V0 ; S) will decrease by a inverse
polynomial. After that, replacing S with S0 (optimal for U0 , V0 ) cannot increase function value, so in polynomial time
we found a new point such that f (U0 , V0 ) ≤ f (U, V) − δ where δ is at least an inverse polynomial. This procedure
cannot be repeated by more than polynomial number of times (because the function value cannot decrease below the
optimal value), so the algorithm finds an approximate optimal point in polynomial time.

Concentrations

In this section we summarize the concentration inequalities we use for different problems.

E.1

Matrix Sensing

Definition 9 (Restrict Isometry Property). Measurement A ({Ai }) satisfies (r, δr )-Restrict Isometry Property (RIP)
if for any matrix X with rank r, we have:
m

(1 − δr )kXk2F ≤

1 X
hAi , Xi2 ≤ (1 + δr )kXk2F
m i=1

In the case of Gaussian measurement, standard analysis shows when m = O( dr
δ 2 ), we have A satisfying (r, δ)-RIP
condition with probability at least 1 − eΩ(d) . (Candes and Plan [2011], Theorem 2.3)
We need the follow inequality for handling noise.
Lemma 34. Suppose the set of sensing matrices A1 , A2 , ..., Am satisfy the (2r, δ)-RIP condition, let n1 , n2 , ..., nm
be iid. Gaussian N (0, σ 2 ), then with high probability for any matrix M of rank at most r, we have

Let X be an -net for rank-r matrices with Frobenius norm 1. By standard constructions we know log |X | ≤
dr log(dr/). We will set  P
= 1/m so log(dr/) = O(log m) (m is at least dr for RIP condition). Now, for any

Matrix Completion

For matrix completion, we need different concentration inequalities for different kinds of matrices. The first kind of
matrix lies in a tangent space and is proved in Candes and Recht [2012].
Lemma 35. Candes and Recht [2012] Let subspace
T = {M ∈ Rd1 ×d2 |M = U? X> + YV?> , for some X ∈ Rd1 ×r , Y ∈ Rd2 ×r }.
for any δ > 0, as long as sample rate p ≥ Ω( δµr
2 d log d), we will have:
1
k PT PΩ PT − PT k ≤ δ
p
For arbitrary low rank matrix, we use the following lemma which comes from graph theory.
Lemma 36. Suppose Ω ⊂ [d1 ] × [d2 ] is the set of edges of a random bipartite graph with (d1 , d2 ) nodes, where any
pair of nodes on different side is connected with probability p. Let d = max d1 , d2 ,then there exists universal constant
log d

On the other hand, for all low-rank matrices we also have the following (which is tighter for incoherent matrices).
Lemma 38. Ge et al. [2016] Let d = max{d1 , d2 }, then with at least probability 1 − eΩ(d) over random choice of Ω,
we have for any rank 2r matrices A ∈ Rd1 ×d2 :

Although Ge et al. [2016] stated the symmetric version, and we need the asymmetric version here, the proof in Ge
et al. [2016] works directly. In fact, they first proved the asymmetric case in the proof.
Finally, for a matrix with each entry randomly sampled independently with small probability p, next lemma says
with high probablity, no row can have too many non-zero entries.
Lemma 39. Let Ωi denote the support of Ω on i-th row, let d = max{d1 , d2 }. Assume pd2 ≥ log(2d), then with at
least probability 1 − 1/poly(d) over random choice of Ω, we have for all i ∈ [d1 ] simultaneously:
|Ωi | ≤ O(pd2 )
Proof. This follows directly from Chernoff bound and union bound.

kUU> − YY> k2F by k(U − Y)(U − Y)> k2F and kU − Yk2F .

k(U − Y)(U − Y)> k2F ≤ 2kUU> − YY> k2F

The last inequality is due to U> Y is a PSD matrix.
Next we show the difference between matrices formed by swapping sigular spaces of M1 and M2 can be upper
bounded by the difference between M1 and M2 .
Lemma 42. Let M1 , M2 ∈ Rd1 ×d2 be two arbitrary matrices whose SVDs are U1 D1 V1> and U2 D2 V2> . Then we
have:
