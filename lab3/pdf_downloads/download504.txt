Figure 2. We used JPEG to compress the Kodak dataset at various quality levels. For each, we then use JPEG to recompress the images,
and plot the resultant rate-distortion curve. It is evident that the more an image has been previously compressed with JPEG, the better
JPEG is able to then recompress it.

Figure 3. The architecture of the discriminator used in our adversarial training procedure. The first module randomly swaps between the
targets and the reconstructions. The goal of the discriminator is to infer which of the two inputs is then the real target, and which is its
reconstruction. We accumulate scalar outputs along branches constructed along the processing pipeline, branched out at different depths.
We average these to attain the final value provided to the objective sigmoid function. This multiscale architecture allows aggregating
information across different scales. In Section 4 of the main text we discuss the motivation for these architectural choices in more detail.
