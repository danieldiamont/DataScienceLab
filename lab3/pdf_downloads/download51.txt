Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

Abstract
Uniform deviation bounds limit the difference between a model‚Äôs expected loss and its loss on a
random sample uniformly for all models in a learning problem. In this paper, we provide a novel
framework to obtain uniform deviation bounds
for unbounded loss functions. As a result, we
obtain competitive uniform deviation bounds for
k-Means clustering under weak assumptions on
the underlying distribution. If the fourth
moment


‚àí 12
is bounded, we prove a rate of O m
com

1
pared to the previously known O m‚àí 4 rate.
We further show that this rate also depends on the
kurtosis ‚Äî the normalized fourth moment which
measures the ‚Äútailedness‚Äù of the distribution. We
also provide improved rates under progressively
stronger assumptions, namely, bounded higher
moments, subgaussianity and bounded support of
the underlying distribution.

1. Introduction
Empirical risk minimization ‚Äî i.e. the training of models on
a finite sample drawn i.i.d from an underlying distribution
‚Äî is a central paradigm in machine learning. The hope is
that models trained on the finite sample perform provably
well even on previously unseen samples from the underlying distribution. But how many samples m are required
to guarantee a low approximation error ? Uniform deviation bounds provide the answer. Informally, they are the
worst-case difference across all possible models between
the empirical loss of a model and its expected loss. As such,
they determine how many samples are required to achieve a
fixed error in terms of the loss function. In this paper, we
consider the popular k-Means clustering problem and provide uniform deviation bounds based on weak assumptions
on the underlying data generating distribution.

Related work. Traditional Vapnik-Chervonenkis theory
provides tools to obtain uniform deviation bounds for binary concept classes such as classification using halfspaces
(Vapnik & Chervonenkis, 1971). While these results have
been extended to provide uniform deviation bounds for sets
of continuous functions bounded in [0, 1] (Haussler, 1992;
Li et al., 2001), these results are not readily applied to kMeans clustering as the underlying loss function in k-Means
clustering is continuous and unbounded.
In their seminal work, Pollard (1981) shows that k-Means
clustering is strongly consistent, i.e., that the optimal cluster
centers on a random sample converge almost surely to the
optimal centers of the distribution under a weak assumption. This has sparked a long line of research on cluster
stability (Ben-David et al., 2006; Rakhlin & Caponnetto,
2007; Shamir & Tishby, 2007; 2008) which investigates the
convergence of optimal parameters both asymptotically and
for finite samples. The vector quantization literature offers
insights into the convergence of empirically optimal quantizers for k-Means
 in terms of the objective: A minimax
1
rate of O m‚àí 2 is known if the underlying distribution
has bounded support (Linder etal., 1994; Bartlett et al.,
1998). A better rate of O m‚àí1 may be achieved for finite support (Antos et al., 2005) or under both bounded
support and regularity assumptions (Levrard et al., 2013).
Ben-David (2007) provides a uniform convergence result for
center based clustering under a bounded support assumption
and Telgarsky & Dasgupta (2013) prove uniform deviation
bounds for k-Means clustering if the underlying distribution
satisfies moment assumptions (see Section 4).
Empirical risk minimization with fat-tailed losses has been
studied in Mendelson et al. (2014), Mendelson (2014),
GruÃànwald & Mehta (2016) and Dinh et al. (2016). Dinh et al.
(2016) provide fast learning rates for k-Means clustering
but under stronger assumptions than the ones considered in
this paper. Guarantees similar to uniform deviation bounds
can be obtained using importance sampling in the context
of coreset construction (Bachem et al., 2015; Lucic et al.,
2016; 2017).
Our contributions. We provide a new framework to obtain
uniform deviation bounds for unbounded loss functions. We
apply it to k-Means clustering and provide
uniform devi

Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

under weak assumptions. In contrast to prior work, our
bounds are all scale-invariant and hold for any set of k cluster centers (not only for a restricted solution set). We show
that convergence depends on the kurtosis of the underlying distribution, which is the normalized fourth moment
and measures the ‚Äútailedness‚Äù of a distribution. If bounded
higher moments are available, we provide improved bounds
that depend upon the normalized higher moments and we
sharpen them even further under the stronger assumptions
of subgaussianity and bounded support.

2. Problem statement for k-Means
We first focus on uniform deviation bounds for k-Means
clustering, and defer the (more technical) framework for
unbounded loss functions to Section 5. We consider the
d-dimensional Euclidean space and define
d(x, Q)2 = minkx ‚àí qk22
q‚ààQ

for any x ‚àà Rd and any finite set Q ‚äÇ Rd . Furthermore,
slightly abusing the notation, for any x, y ‚àà Rd , we set
d(x, y)2 = d(x, {y})2 = kx ‚àí yk22 .
d
Statistical k-Means. Let P
 be any2 distribution on R with
2
¬µ = EP [x] and œÉ = EP d(x, ¬µ) ‚àà (0, ‚àû). For any set
Q ‚äÇ Rd of k ‚àà N cluster
 centers,
 the expected quantization
error is given by EP d(x, Q)2 . The goal of the statistical
k-Means problem is to find a set of k cluster centers such
that the expected quantization error is minimized.

Empirical k-Means. Let X denote a finite set of points in
Rd . The goal of the empirical k-Means problem is to find
a set Q of k cluster centers in Rd such that the empirical
quantization error œÜX (Q) is minimized, where
1 X
œÜX (Q) =
d(x, Q)2 .

Empirical risk minimization. In practice, the underlying
data distribution P in statistical learning problems is often
unknown. Instead, one is only able to observe independent
samples from P . The empirical risk minimization principle
advocates that finding a good solution on a random sample Xm also provides provably good solutions to certain
statistical learning problems if enough samples m are used.
Uniform deviation bounds. For k-Means, such a result
may be shown by bounding the deviation between the expected loss and the empirical error, i.e.,



œÜXm (Q) ‚àí EP d(x, Q)2  ,
uniformly for all possible clusterings Q ‚àà Rd√ók . If this
difference is sufficiently small for a given m, one may then
solve the empirical k-Means problem on Xm and obtain
provable guarantees on the expected quantization error.

3. Uniform deviation bounds for k-Means
A simple approach would be to bound the deviation by an
absolute error , i.e., to require that



œÜXm (Q) ‚àí EP d(x, Q)2  ‚â§ 
(1)
uniformly for a set of possible solutions (Telgarsky & Dasgupta, 2013). However, in this paper, we provide uniform
deviation bounds of a more general form: For any distribution P and a sample of m = f (, Œ¥, k, d, P ) points, we
require that with probability at least 1 ‚àí Œ¥



m
2
2
(2)
uniformly for all Q ‚àà Rd√ók . The terms on the right-hand
side may be interpreted as follows: The first term based on
the variance œÉ 2 corresponds to a scale-invariant, additive
approximation error. The second term is a multiplicative approximation error that allows the guarantee to hold even for
solutions Q with a large expected quantization error. Similar
additive error terms were recently explored by Bachem et al.
(2016; 2017) in the context of seeding for k-Means.
There are three key reasons why we choose (2) over (1):
First, (1) is not scale-invariant and may thus not hold for
classes of distributions that are equal up to scaling. Second, (1) may not hold for an unbounded solution space, e.g.
Rd√ók . Third, we can always rescale P to unit variance
 and
restrict ourselves to solutions Q with EP d(x, Q)2 ‚â§ œÉ 2 .
Then, (2) implies (1) for a suitable transformation of P .
Importance of scale-invariance. If we scale all the points
in a data set X and all possible sets of solutions Q by some
Œª > 0, then the empirical quantization error is scaled by
Œª2 . Similarly, if we consider the random variable Œªx where
x ‚àº P , then the expected quantization error is scaled by
Œª2 . At the same time, the k-Means problem remains the
same: an optimal solution of the scaled problem is simply a
scaled optimal solution of the original problem. Crucially,
however, it is impossible to achieve the guarantee in (1) for
distributions that are equal up to scaling: Suppose that (1)
holds for some error tolerance , and sample size m with
probability at least 1 ‚àí Œ¥. Consider a distribution P and a
solution Q ‚àà Rd√ók such that with probability at least Œ¥

let PÃÉ be the distribution of

the random variable Œªx where x ‚àº P and let XÃÉm consist of
m samples from PÃÉ . Defining QÃÉ = {Œªq | q ‚àà Q}, we have

For example, let P be a nondegenerate multivariate normal

which contradicts (1) for the distribution PÃÉ and the solution QÃÉ. Hence, (1) cannot hold for both P and its scaled
transformation PÃÉ .
Unrestricted solution space One way to guarantee scaleinvariance would be require that


œÜXm (Q) ‚àí EP d(x, Q)2  ‚â§ œÉ 2

(3)

for all Q ‚àà Rd√ók . However, while (3) is scale-invariant, it is
also impossible to achieve for all solutions Q as the following example shows. For simplicity, consider the 1-Means
problem in 1-dimensional space and let P be a distribution
with zero mean. Let Xm denote m independent samples
from P and denote by ¬µÃÇ the mean of Xm . For any finite m,
suppose that ¬µÃÇ 6= 0 with high probability2 and consider a
solution Q consisting of a single point q ‚àà R. We then have



= œÜX ({¬µÃÇ}) ‚àí œÉ 2 + ¬µÃÇ2 ‚àí 2q ¬µÃÇ

m

Since ¬µÃÇ 6= 0 with high probability, clearly this expression
diverges as q ‚Üí ‚àû and thus (3) cannot hold for arbitrary
solutions Q ‚àà Rd√ók . Intuitively, the key issue is that both
the empirical and the statistical error become unbounded as
q ‚Üí ‚àû. Previous approaches such as Telgarsky & Dasgupta
(2013) solve this issue by restricting the solution space from
Rd√ók to solutions that are no worse than some threshold. In
contrast, we allow the deviation between the empirical
and

the expected quantization error to scale with EP d(x, Q)2 .
Arbitrary distributions. Finally, we show that we either
need to impose assumptions on P or equivalently make the
relationship between m,  and Œ¥ in (2) depend on the underlying distribution P . Suppose that there exists a sample size
m ‚àà N, an error tolerance  ‚àà (0, 1) and a maximal failure
probability Œ¥ ‚àà (0, 1) such that (2) holds for any distribution
P . Let P be the Bernoulli distribution on {0, 1} ‚äÇ R with
1
m
P [x = 1] = p for p ‚àà (Œ¥
 , 1). 2By
 design, we have ¬µ = p,
2
œÉ = p(1 ‚àí p) and EP d(x, 1) = (1 ‚àí p). Furthermore,
with probability at least Œ¥, the set Xm of m independent
samples from P consists of m copies of a point at one.
Hence, (2) implies that with probability at least 1 ‚àí Œ¥


since œÉ 2 ‚â§ EP d(x, 1)2 . However, with probability at
least Œ¥, we have œÜXm (1) = 0 which would imply 1 ‚â§  and
thus lead to a contradiction with  ‚àà (0, 1).

For example, if P is the standard normal distribution.

4. Key results for k-Means
In this section, we present our main results for k-Means and
defer the analysis and proofs to Sections 6.
4.1. Kurtosis bound
Similar to Telgarsky & Dasgupta (2013), the weakest assumption that we require is that the fourth moment of
d(x, ¬µ) for x ‚àà P is bounded.3 Our results are based on the
kurtosis of P which we define as


EP d(x, ¬µ)4
.
MÃÇ4 =
œÉ4
The kurtosis is the normalized fourth moment and is a scaleinvariant measure of the ‚Äútailedness‚Äù of a distribution. For
example, the normal distribution has a kurtosis of 3, while
more heavy tailed distributions such as the t-Student distribution or the Pareto distribution have a potentially unbounded kurtosis. A natural interpretation of the kurtosis is
provided by Moors (1986). For simplicity, consider a data
set with unit variance. Then, the kurtosis may be restated as
the shifted variance of d(x, ¬µ)2 , i.e.,

MÃÇ4 = Var d(x, ¬µ)2 + 1.
This provides a valuable insight into why the kurtosis is relevant for our setting: For simplicity, suppose we would like
to estimate the expected quantization error EP d(x, ¬µ)2
by the empirical quantization error œÜXm ({¬µ}) on a finite
sample Xm .4 Then, the kurtosis measures
 the dispersion
of d(x, ¬µ)2 around its mean EP d(x, ¬µ)2 and provides a
bound on how many samples are required to achieve an error
of . While this simple example provides the key insight
for the trivial solution Q = {¬µ}, it requires a non-trivial
effort to extend the guarantee in (2) to hold uniformly for
all solutions Q ‚àà Rd√ók .
With the use of a novel framework to learn unbounded loss
functions (presented in Section 5), we are able to provide
the following guarantee for k-Means.
Theorem 1 (Kurtosis). Let , Œ¥ ‚àà (0, 1) and k ‚àà N. Let P
be any distribution on Rd with kurtosis MÃÇ4 < ‚àû. For

While our random variables x ‚àà P are potentially multivariate, it suffices to consider the behavior of the univariate random
variable d(x, ¬µ) for the assumptions in thissection. 

This is a hypothetical exercise as EP d(x, ¬µ)2 = 1 by design. However, it provides an insight to the importance of the
kurtosis.

samples are required such that the guarantee holds

for a single solution Q ‚àà Rd√ók . Informally, a generalization of the Vapnik Chervonenkis dimension for k-Means
clustering may be bounded by O(dk log k) and measures
the ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù of the learning problem. The multiplicative dk log k + log 1Œ¥ term intuitively extends the guarantee
uniformly to all possible Q ‚àà Rd√ók .
Comparison to Telgarsky & Dasgupta (2013). While we
require a bound on the normalized fourth moment, i.e., the
kurtosis, Telgarsky & Dasgupta (2013) consider the case
where all unnormalized moments up to the fourth are uniformly bounded by some M , i.e.,

4.3. Subgaussianity
If the distribution P is subgaussian, then all its moments
MÃÇp are bounded. By optimizing p in Theorem 2, we are
able to show the following bound.
Theorem 3 (Subgaussian bound). Let  ‚àà (0, 1), Œ¥ ‚àà (0, 1)

samples are hence sufficient. This result features a polylogarithmic dependence on 1Œ¥ compared to the polynomial
dependence for the bounds based on bounded higher moments. The sufficient sample size further scales linearly
with the (scale-invariant) subgaussianity parameters a and b.
For example, if P is a one-dimensional normal distribution
of any scale, we would have a = 2 and b = 1.
4.4. Bounded support
The strongest assumption that we consider is if the support
of P is bounded by a hypersphere in Rd with diameter
R > 0. This ensures that almost surely d(x, ¬µ) ‚â§ R and
4
hence MÃÇ4 ‚â§ R
œÉ 4 . This allows us to obtain Theorem 4.
Theorem 4 (Bounded support). Let  ‚àà (0, 1), Œ¥ ‚àà (0, 1)

The proof is provided in Section 6.4. Again, the sufficient
4
sample size scales linearly with the kurtosis bound R
œÉ 4 . However, the bound is only logarithmic in 1Œ¥ .

5. Framework for unbounded loss functions
To obtain the results presented in Section 4, we propose a
novel framework to uniformly approximate the expected
values of a set of unbounded functions based on a random
sample. We consider a function family F mapping from
an arbitrary input space X to R‚â•0 and a distribution P
on X . We further require a generalization of the VapnikChervonenkis dimension to continuous, unbounded functions5 ‚Äî the pseudo-dimension.
Definition 1 (Haussler (1992); Li et al. (2001)). The pseudodimension of a set F of functions from X to R‚â•0 , denoted by Pdim(F), is the largest d0 such there is a sequence x1 , . . . , xd0 of domain elements from X and a sequence r1 , . . . , rd0 of reals such that for each b1 , . . . , bd0 ‚àà
{above, below}, there is an f ‚àà F such that for all
i = 1, . . . , d0 , we have f (xi ) ‚â• ri ‚áê‚áí bi = above.
Similar to the VC dimension, the pseudo-dimension measures the cardinality of the largest subset of X that can be
shattered by the function family F. Informally, the pseudodimension measures the richness of F and plays a critical
role in providing a uniform approximation guarantee across
all f ‚àà F. With this notion, we are able to state the main
result in our framework.

Applying Theorem 5 to a function family F requires three
steps: First, one needs to bound the pseudo-dimension of
5

The pseudo-dimension was originally defined for sets of functions mapping to [0, 1] (Haussler, 1992; Li et al., 2001). However,
it is trivially extended to unbounded functions mapping to R‚â•0 .

such that

Ideally, such a bound should be as tight as possible. Third,
one needs to find some t > 0 and a sample size

samples to guarantee that (7) does not hold for a single
f ‚àà F with probability at least 1 ‚àí 2Œ¥ .
To bound the probability that there exists any f ‚àà F such
that (7) holds, we show in Lemma 5 (see Section B of the
Supplementary Materials) that, given independent samples
x1 , x2 , . . . , x2m ,

2

a bound t may only be found if EP s(x) is bounded
and that assumptions on the distribution P are required. In
Section 6,

We defer the proof of Theorem 5 to Section B of the Supplementary Materials and provide a short proof sketch that captures the main insight. The proof is based on symmetrization,
the bounding of covering numbers and chaining ‚Äî common techniques in the empirical process literature (Pollard,
1984; Li et al., 2001; Boucheron et al., 2013; Koltchinskii,
2011; van der Vaart & Wellner, 1996). The novelty lies in
considering loss functions f (¬∑) and cover functions s(¬∑) in
Theorem 5 that are potentially unbounded.
Proof sketch. Our proof is based on a double sampling approach. Let xm+1 , xm+2 , . . . , x2m be an additional m independent samples from P and let œÉ1 , œÉ2 , . . . , œÉm be independent random variables uniformly
h
isampled from {‚àí1, 1}.
2

Then, we show that, if EP s(x) ‚â§ t, the probability
of (6) not holding may be bounded by the probability that
there exists a f ‚àà F such that


m

œÉi (f (xi ) ‚àí f (xi+m )) > .
(7)

m

i=1

We first provide the intuition for a single function f ‚àà F and
then show how we extend it to all f ‚àà F. While the function
f (x) is not bounded, for a given sample x1 , x2 , . . . , x2m ,
each f (xi ) is contained within [0, s(xi )]. Given the sample
x1 , x2 , . . . , x2m , the random variable œÉi (f (xi ) ‚àí f (xi+m )
is bounded in 0 ¬± max (s(xi ), s(xi+m )) and has zero mean.
Hence, given independent samples x1 , x2 , . . . , x2m , the
probability of (7) occurring for a single f ‚àà F can be

The key difficulty in proving Lemma 5 is that the functions
f ‚àà F are not bounded uniformly in [0, 1]. To this end,
we provide in Lemma 4 a novel result that bounds the size
of -packings of F if the functions f ‚àà F are bounded in
expectation. Based on Lemma 5, we then prove the main
claim of Theorem 5.

6. Analysis for k-Means
In order to apply Theorem 5 to k-Means clustering, we require a hsuitablei family F, an upper bound s(x) and a bound
2

on EP s(x) . We provide this in Lemma 1 and defer
P2m

bounding 2m
i=1 s(xi ) to the proofs of Theorems 2-4.

Lemma 1 (k-Means). Let k ‚àà N. Let P be any
 distribution
on Rd with ¬µ = EP [x], œÉ 2 = EP d(x, ¬µ)2 ‚àà (0, ‚àû) and
bounded kurtosis MÃÇ4 . For any x ‚àà Rd and any Q ‚àà Rd√ók ,
define
d(x, Q)2

as well as the function family F = fQ (¬∑) | Q ‚àà Rd√ók .
Let

s(x) =
+ 8.

We then have
Pdim(F) ‚â§ 6k(d + 4) log 6k,

for any x ‚àà Rd and Q ‚àà Rd√ók and
h

2
EP s(x) = 128 + 16MÃÇ4 .

(11)

The proof of Lemma 1 is provided in Section C of the
Supplementary Materials. The definition of fQ (x) in (8) is
motivated as follows: If we use Theorem 5 to guarantee

as is required by Theorems 2-4. Lemma 1 further shows
2
that E [s(x)] is bounded if and only if the kurtosis of P is
bounded. This is the reason why a bounded kurtosis is the
weakest assumption on P that we require in Section 4.
We now proceed to prove Theorems 2-4 by applying
P2m Theo2

7. Conclusion
We have presented a framework to uniformly approximate
the expected value of unbounded functions on a sample.
With this framework we are able to provide theoretical guarantees for empirical risk minimization in k-Means clustering
if the kurtosis of the underlying distribution is bounded. In
particular, we obtain state-of-the art bounds on the sufficient
number of samples to achieve a given uniform approximation error. If the underlying distribution fulfills stronger
assumptions, such as bounded higher moments, subgaussianity or bounded support, our analysis yields progressively
better bounds. We conjecture that Theorem 5 can be applied
to other related problems such as hard and soft Bregman
clustering, likelihood estimation of Gaussian mixture models, as well as nonparametric clustering problems. However,
such results do not follow immediately and require additional arguments beyond the scope of this paper.

Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

A. Auxiliary lemmas

For j ‚â• 2, we have

For the following proofs we require two auxiliary lemmas.
Lemma 2. Let x > 0 and a > 0. If
x ‚â§ a log x

(23)

x ‚â§ 2a log 2a.

(24)

then it holds that

‚àö
‚àö
Proof. Since x > 0, we have x > 0 and thus log x ‚â§
‚àö
x. Together with (23), this implies
x ‚â§ a log x = 2a log

‚àö

‚àö
x ‚â§ 2a x,

and thus
x ‚â§ 4a2 .
We show the result by contradiction. Suppose that
x > 2a log 2a.

B. Proof of Theorem 5
We first show two results, Lemma 4 and 5 and then use them
to prove Theorem 5.
Definition 2. Let F be a family of functions from X to R‚â•0
and Q an arbitrary measure on X . For any f, g ‚àà F, we
define the distance function
Z
dL1 (Q) (f, g) =
|f (x) ‚àí g(x)| dQ(x).
X

For any f ‚àà F and A ‚äÜ F, we further define
dL1 (Q) (f, A) = min dL1 (Q) (f, g).
g‚ààA

Definition 3. For  > 0, a set A ‚äÜ B is an -packing of B
with respect to some metric d if for any two distinct x, y ‚àà A,
d(x, y) > . The cardinality of the largest -packing of B
with respect to d is denoted by M (, B, d).

Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

Lemma 4 (-packing). Let F be a family of functions from
X to R‚â•0 with Pdim(F ) = d. For all x ‚àà X , let s(x) =
supf ‚ààF f (x). Let Q be an arbitrary measure on X with
0 < EQ [s(x)] < ‚àû. Then, for all 0 <  ‚â§ EQ [s(x)],

Consider the set X0 = {x ‚àà X : s(x) = 0} and define
X>0 = X \ X0 . By definition of QÃÉ, X0 is zero set of
QÃÉ
R and, since f (x), g(x) ‚àà [0, s(x)] for all x ‚àà X , we have
|f (x) ‚àí g(x)| dQ(x) = 0.

Proof. Our proof is similar to the proof of Theorem 6
in Haussler (1992). The difference is that we consider a
function family F that is not uniformly bounded but only
bounded in expectation. The key idea is to construct a random sample and to use the expected number of dichotomies
on that set to bound the size of an -packing by the pseudodimension.
Noting that by definition s(x) ‚â• 0 and EQ [s(x)] < ‚àû, we
define the probability measure QÃÉ on X using the RadonNikodym derivative
dQÃÉ(x)
s(x)
=

Let ~x = (x1 , x2 , . . . , xm ) be a random vector in X m , where
each xi is drawn independently at random from QÃÉ. Given
~x, let ~r = (r1 , r2 , . . . , rm ) be a random vector, where each
ri is drawn independently at random from a uniform distribution on [0, s(xi )].
For any f
‚àà
F, we denote the restriction
(f (x1 ), . . . , f (xm )) by f~x and set F~x = {f~x | f ‚àà F}.
For any vector ~z ‚àà Rm , we define

This allows us to bound the probability that two distinct
f, g ‚àà G produce the same dichotomy on all m samples, i.e.
P [sign(f~x ‚àí ~r) = sign(g~x ‚àí ~r)]

For j ‚àà N, let Œ≥j = EQ [s(x)] /2j . We define a sequence
G1 , G2 , . . . , G‚àû of Œ≥j -packings of F as follows: Let the set
G0 consist of an arbitrary element f ‚àà F. For any j ‚àà N,
we initialize Gj to Gj‚àí1 . Then, we select a single element
f ‚àà F with dL1 (Q) (f, Gj ) > Œ≥j and add it to Gj . We repeat
this until no such element f ‚àà F with dL1 (Q) (f, Gj ) > Œ≥j
is left. By definition, Gj is an Œ≥j -packing of F with respect
to dL1 (Q) . Hence, for any f ‚àà F, we have
dL1 (Q) (f, Gj ) ‚â§ Œ≥j = EQ [s(x)] /2j .

(29)

Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

By Lemma 4, the size of Gj is bounded by
|Gj |‚â§ 2(2e2j )2d = 22d(j+1)+1 e2d .

(30)

for some Œ∫ > 0. By (29) and j sufficiently large, there
exists a g ‚àà G such that
dL1 (Q) (f, g) <

For each f ‚àà F and j ‚àà N, we define the closest element
in Gj by
œÜj (f ) = arg min dL1 (Q) (f, g).
g‚ààGj

By (30), Gj is finite for each j ‚àà N and the minimum is
well-defined.

(32)

The key idea is that intuitively any f ‚àà F can be additively decomposed into functions from the sequence
H1 , H2 , . . . , H‚àû . By definition, for any j ‚àà N, any function g ‚àà Gj can be rewritten as
hg,k

where (hg,1 , hg,2 , . . . , hg,j ) are functions in H1 √ó H2 √ó

Xi = œÉi (h(xi ) ‚àí h(xi+m )).
Since œÉi are uniformly drawn at random from {‚àí1, 1}, we
have E [Xi ] = 0 for all i ‚àà {1, 2, . . . , m}. Furthermore,
each Xi is bounded in
[ai , bi ] = [0 ¬± (h(xi ) ‚àí h(xi+m ))].

Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

C. Proof of Lemma 1
Proof. We first show (9) with the same notation as in the
proof of Lemma 4. For any f ‚àà F, ~x ‚àà X m and ~r ‚àà Rm ,
we denote the restriction (f (x1 ), . . . , f (xm )) by f~x and set
F~x = {f~x | f ‚àà F}. For any vector ~z ‚àà Rm , we define
sign(~z) = (sign(z1 ), . . . , sign(zm )) .

By (42), both F and G induce the same dichotomies on
(xÃÑ, rÃÑ) and (xÃÉ, ~0) respectively and thus
|sign(FxÃÑ ‚àí rÃÑ)| = |sign(GxÃÉ )| .

(43)

We define the function family


H = min h¬∑, qÃÉi | Q ‚àà R(d+3)√ók
qÃÉ‚ààQ

The set of dichotomies induced by ~r on F~x is given by
and note that by construction G ‚äÜ H. This implies
sign(F~x ‚àí ~r) = {sign(f~x ‚àí ~r) | f ‚àà F} .

|sign(GxÃÉ )| ‚â§ |sign(HxÃÉ )| .

Let mÃÑ be equal to the pseudo-dimension of F. This implies
that there exist two vectors xÃÑ ‚àà X mÃÑ and rÃÑ ‚àà RmÃÑ that are
shattered by F, i.e.,
|sign(FxÃÑ ‚àí rÃÑ)| = 2mÃÑ .

(41)

Consider any x ‚àà ~x, its corresponding

r ‚àà ~r and any

k

|sign(HxÃÉ )| ‚â§ |sign(IxÃÉ )| .

(45)

The dichotomies induced by I are generated by halfspaces
in Rd+3 . The Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension of halfspaces
in Rd+3 is bounded by d + 4 (Har-Peled, 2011) and thus
Pdim(I) ‚â§ d + 4. Together with Sauer‚Äôs Lemma (Sauer,

Uniform Deviation Bounds for k-Means Clustering

Next, we prove (10). For any x ‚àà Rd and Q ‚àà Rd√ók , we
have by the triangle inequality
d(x, Q)2 ‚â§ (d(x, ¬µ) + d(¬µ, Q))

2

= d(x, ¬µ)2 + d(¬µ, Q)2 + 2 d(x, ¬µ) d(¬µ, Q)
For any 0 ‚â§ a ‚â§ b, it holds that
2ab = ab + a(b ‚àí a) + a2 ‚â§ ab + b(b ‚àí a) + a2 = b2 + a2 .
Since either 0 ‚â§ d(x, ¬µ) ‚â§ d(¬µ, Q) or 0 ‚â§ d(¬µ, Q) <
d(x, ¬µ), we thus have for any x ‚àà Rd and Q ‚àà Rd√ók
d(x, Q)2 ‚â§ 2 d(x, ¬µ)2 + 2 d(¬µ, Q)2 .

(48)

By the same argument it also holds that for any x ‚àà Rd and
Q ‚àà Rd√ók
d(¬µ, Q)2 ‚â§ 2 d(x, ¬µ)2 + 2 d(x, Q)2 .
By takingthe expectation
with regards to P and noting that

œÉ 2 = EP d(x, ¬µ)2 < ‚àû, we obtain for any Q ‚àà Rd√ók


d(¬µ, Q)2 ‚â§ 2œÉ 2 + 2EP d(x, Q)2 .

(49)

Combining (48) and (49) implies that for any x ‚àà Rd and
