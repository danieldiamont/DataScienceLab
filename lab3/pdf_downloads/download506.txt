Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

Carlos Riquelme 1 Mohammad Ghavamzadeh 2 Alessandro Lazaric 3

Abstract
We explore the sequential decision-making problem where the goal is to estimate a number of linear models uniformly well, given a shared budget
of random contexts independently sampled from
a known distribution. For each incoming context,
the decision-maker selects one of the linear models and receives an observation that is corrupted
by the unknown noise level of that model. We
present Trace-UCB, an adaptive allocation algorithm that learns the models’ noise levels while
balancing contexts accordingly across them, and
prove bounds for its simple regret in both expectation and high-probability. We extend the algorithm and its bounds to the high dimensional setting, where the number of linear models times
the dimension of the contexts is more than the
total budget of samples. Simulations with real
data suggest that Trace-UCB is remarkably robust, outperforming a number of baselines even
when its assumptions are violated.

1. Introduction
We study the problem faced by a decision-maker whose
goal is to estimate a number of regression problems equally
well (i.e., with a small prediction error for each of them),
and has to adaptively allocate a limited budget of samples
to the problems in order to gather information and improve
its estimates. Two aspects of the problem formulation are
key and drive the algorithm design: 1) The observations
Y collected from each regression problem depend on side
information (i.e., contexts X ∈ Rd ) and we model the relationship between X and Y in each problem i as a linear
function with unknown parameters βi ∈ Rd , and 2) The
“hardness” of learning each parameter βi is unknown in advance and may vary across the problems. In particular, we

assume that the observations are corrupted by noise levels
that are problem-dependent and must be learned as well.
This scenario may arise in a number of different domains
where a fixed experimentation budget (number of samples)
should be allocated to different problems. Imagine a drug
company that has developed several treatments for a particular form of disease. Now it is interested in having an accurate estimate of the performance of each of these treatments
for a specific population of patients (e.g., at a particular
geographical location). Given the budget allocated to this
experiment, a number of patients n can participate in the
clinical trial. Volunteered patients arrive sequentially over
time and they are represented by a context X ∈ Rd summarizing their profile. We model the health status of patient X
after being assigned to treatment i by scalar Yi ∈ R, which
depends on the specific drug through a linear function with
parameter βi (i.e., Yi ≈ X T βi ). The goal is to assign each
incoming patient to a treatment in such a way that at the end
of the trial, we have an accurate estimate for all βi ’s. This
will allow us to reliably predict the expected health status
of each new patient X for any treatment i. Since the parameters βi and the noise levels are initially unknown, achieving this goal requires an adaptive allocation strategy for the
n patients. Note that while n may be relatively small, as
the ethical and financial costs of treating a patient are high,
the distribution of the contexts X (e.g., the biomarkers of
cancer patients) can be precisely estimated in advance.
This setting is clearly related to the problem of pure exploration and active learning in multi-armed bandits (Antos et al., 2008), where the learner wants to estimate the
mean of a finite set of arms by allocating a finite budget
of n pulls. Antos et al. (2008) first introduced this setting
where the objective is to minimize the largest mean square
error (MSE) in estimating the value of each arm. While
the optimal solution is trivially to allocate the pulls proportionally to the variance of the arms, when the variances
are unknown an exploration-exploitation dilemma arises,
where variance and value of the arms must be estimated at
the same time in order to allocate pulls where they are more
needed (i.e., arms with high variance). Antos et al. (2008)
proposed
√ a forcing algorithm where all arms are pulled at
least n times before allocating pulls proportionally to the
estimated variances. They derived bounds on the regret,
measuring the difference between the MSEs of the learn-

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

ing algorithm and an optimal allocation showing that the
regret decreases as O(n−3/2 ). A similar result is obtained
by Carpentier et al. (2011) that proposed two algorithms
that use upper confidence bounds on the variance to estimate the MSE of each arm and select the arm with the
larger MSE at each step. When the arms are embedded
in Rd and their mean is a linear combination with an unknown parameter, then the problem becomes an optimal
experimental design problem (Pukelsheim, 2006), where
the objective is to estimate the linear parameter and minimize the prediction error over all arms (see e.g., Wiens &
Li 2014; Sabato & Munos 2014). In this paper, we consider
an orthogonal extension to the original problem where a finite number of linear regression problems is available (i.e.,
the arms) and random contexts are observed at each time
step. Similarly to the setting of Antos et al. (2008), we
assume each problem is characterized by a noise with different variance and the objective is to return regularized
least-squares (RLS) estimates with small prediction error
(i.e., MSE). While we leverage on the solution proposed
by Carpentier et al. (2011) to deal with the unknown variances, in our setting the presence of random contexts make
the estimation problem considerably more difficult. In fact,
the MSE in one specific regression problem is not only determined by the variance of the noise and the number of
samples used to compute the RLS estimate, but also by the
contexts observed over time.
Contributions. We propose T RACE -UCB, an algorithm
that simultaneously learns the “hardness” of each problem,
allocates observations proportionally to these estimates,
and balances contexts across problems. We derive performance bounds for T RACE -UCB in expectation and highprobability, and compare the algorithm with several baselines. T RACE -UCB performs remarkably well in scenarios
where the dimension of the contexts or the number of instances is large compared to the total budget, motivating the
study of the high-dimensional setting, whose analysis and
performance bounds are reported in App. F of Riquelme
et al. (2017a). Finally, we provide simulations with synthetic data that support our theoretical results, and with real
data that demonstrate the robustness of our approach even
when some of the assumptions do not hold.

2. Preliminaries
The problem. We consider m linear regression problems,
where each instance i ∈ [m] = {1, . . . , m} is characterized
by a parameter βi ∈ Rd such that for any context X ∈ Rd ,
a random observation Y ∈ R is obtained as
Y = X T βi + i ,

(1)

where the noise i is an i.i.d. realization of a Gaussian dis2
tribution N (0, σi2 ). We denote by σmax
= maxi σi2 and

P
by σ 2 = 1/m i σi2 , the largest and the average variance,
respectively. We define a sequential decision-making problem over n rounds, where at each round t ∈ [n], the learning algorithm A receives a context Xt drawn i.i.d. from
N (0, Σ), selects an instance It , and observes a random
sample YIt ,t according to (1). By the end of the experiment,
a training set Dn = {Xt , It , YIt ,t }t∈[n] has been collected
and all the m linear regression problems are solved, each
problem i ∈ [m] with its own training set Di,n (i.e., a subset of Dn containing samples with It = i), and estimates
of the parameters {β̂i,n }i∈[m] are returned. For each β̂i,n ,
we measure its accuracy by the mean-squared error (MSE)


Li,n (β̂i,n ) = EX (X T βi −X T β̂i,n )2 = kβi − β̂i,n k2Σ . (2)
We evaluate the overall accuracy of the estimates returned
by the algorithm A as


Ln (A) = max EDn Li,n (β̂i,n ) ,
(3)
i∈[m]

where the expectation is w.r.t. the randomness of the contexts Xt and observations Yi,t used to compute β̂i,n . The
objective is to design an algorithm A that minimizes the
loss (3). This requires defining an allocation rule to select
the instance It at each step t and the algorithm to compute the estimates β̂i,n , e.g., ordinary least-squares (OLS),
regularized least-squares (RLS), or Lasso. In designing a
learning algorithm, we rely on the following assumption.
Assumption 1. The covariance matrix Σ of the Gaussian
distribution generating the contexts {Xt }nt=1 is known.
This is a standard assumption in active learning, since in
this setting the learner has access to the input distribution and the main question is for which context she should
ask for a label (Sabato & Munos, 2014; Riquelme et al.,
2017b). Often times, companies, like the drug company
considered in the introduction, own enough data to have
an accurate estimate of the distribution of their customers
(patients).
While in the rest of the paper we focus on Ln (A), our algorithm and analysis can be easily extended to similar objectives such as replacing the maximum
in (3) with average

Pm
across all instances, i.e., 1/m i=1 EDn Li,n (β̂i,n ) , and


using weighted errors, i.e., maxi wi EDn Li,n (β̂i,n ) , by
updating the score to focus on the estimated standard deviation and by including the weights in the score, respectively. Later in the paper, we also consider the case where
the expectation in (3) is replaced by the high-probability
error (see Eq. 17).
Optimal static allocation with OLS estimates. While the
distribution of the contexts is fixed and does not depend on
the instance i, the errors Li,n (β̂i,n ) directly depend on the
variances σi2 of the noise i . We define an optimal baseline

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

obtained when the noise variances {σi2 }m
i=1 are known. In
particular, we focus on a static allocation algorithm Astat
that selects each instance i exactly ki,n times, independently of the context,1 and returns an estimate β̂i,n computed by OLS as

where Xi,n ∈ Rki,n ×d is the matrix of (random) samples

show that the global error corresponding to Astat is

mean variance should be pulled more often. In any case,
we see that the correction to the context-free allocation
(i.e., the second term) is constant, as it does not depend on
n. Nonetheless, it does depend on d and this suggests that
in high-dimensional problems, it may significantly skew
the optimal allocation.
While A∗stat effectively minimizes the prediction loss Ln ,
it cannot be implemented in practice since the optimal allocation ki∗ requires the variances σi2 to be known at the
beginning of the experiment. As a result, we need to devise
a learning algorithm A whose performance approaches L∗n
as n increases. More formally, we define the regret of A as
Rn (A) = Ln (A) − Ln (A∗stat ) = Ln (A) − L∗n ,

(9)

and we expect Rn (A) = o(1/n). In fact, any allocation
strategy that selects each instance a linear number of times
(e.g., uniform sampling) achieves a loss Ln = O(1/n), and
thus, a regret of order O(1/n). However, we expect that the
loss of an effective learning algorithm decreases not just at
the same rate as L∗n but also with the very same constant,
thus implying a regret that decreases faster than O(1/n).

(6)

Thus, we derive the following proposition for the optimal
static allocation algorithm A∗stat .
Proposition 1. Given m linear regression problems, each
characterized by a parameter βi , Gaussian noise with variance σi2 , and Gaussian contexts with covariance Σ, let
n > m(d + 1), then the optimal OLS static allocation algorithm A∗stat selects each instance

Proof. See Appendix A.1.2
Proposition 1 divides the problems into two types: those
for which σi2 ≥ σ̄ 2 (wild instances) and those for which
σi2 < σ̄ 2 (mild instances). We see that for the first type,
the second term in (7) is negative and the instance should
be selected less frequently than in the context-free case
(where the optimal allocation is given just by the first term).
On the other hand, instances whose variance is below the

3. The T RACE -UCB Algorithm
In this section, we present and analyze an algorithm of
the form discussed at the end of Section 2, which we
call T RACE -UCB, whose pseudocode is in Algorithm 1.

The regularization parameter λ = O(1/n) is provided to
the algorithm as input, while in practice one could set λ

Intuition. Equation (6) suggests that while the parameters
of the context distribution, particularly its covariance Σ, do

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

not impact the prediction error, the noise variances play the
most important role in the loss of each problem instance.
∗
This is in fact confirmed by the optimal allocation ki,n
2
in (7), where only the variances σi appear. This evidence
suggests that an algorithm similar to GAFS-MAX (Antos
et al., 2008) or CH-AS (Carpentier et al., 2011), which
were designed for the context-free case (i.e., each instance i
is associated to an expected value and not a linear function)
would be effective in this setting as well. Nonetheless, (6)
holds only for static allocation algorithms that completely
ignore the context and the history to decide which instance
It to choose at time t. On the other hand, adaptive learning
algorithms create a strong correlation between the dataset
Dt−1 collected so far, the current context Xt , and the decision It . As a result, the sample matrix Xi,t is no longer a
random variable independent of A, and using (6) to design
a learning algorithm is not convenient, since the impact of
the contexts on the error is completely overlooked. Unfortunately, in general, it is very difficult to study the potential
correlation between the contexts Xi,t , the intermediate estimates β̂i,t , and the most suitable choice It . However, in
the next lemma, we show that if at each step t, we select It
as a function of Dt−1 , and not Xt , we may still recover an
expression for the final loss that we can use as a basis for
the construction of an effective learning algorithm.
Lemma 2. Let A be a learning algorithm that selects
the instances It as a function of the previous history,
i.e., Dt−1 = {X1 , I1 , YI1 ,1 , . . . , Xt−1 , It−1 , YIt−1 ,t−1 }
and computes estimates βbi,n using OLS. Then, its loss after
n steps can be expressed as

Proof. See Appendix B.
Remark 1 (assumptions). We assume noise and contexts
are Gaussian. The noise Gaussianity is crucial for the es2
timates of the parameter βbi,t and variance σ
bi,t
to be independent of each other, for each instance i and time t (we
actually need and derive a stronger result in Lemma 9, see
Appendix B). This is key in proving Lemma 2, as it allows
us to derive a closed form expression for the loss function
which holds under our algorithm, and is written in terms of
the number of pulls and the trace of the inverse empirical
2
covariance matrix. Note that βbi,t drives our loss, while σ
bi,t
drives our decisions. One way to remove this assumption is
by defining and directly optimizing a surrogate loss equal
to (10) instead of (3). On the other hand, the Gaussianity of
contexts leads to the whitened inverse covariance estimate
b −1 being distributed as an inverse Wishart. As there
ΣΣ
i,n

is a convenient closed formula for its mean, we can find
∗
the exact optimal static allocation ki,n
in Proposition 1, see
(7). In general, for sub-Gaussian contexts, no such closed
formula for the trace is available. However, as long as the
∗
optimal allocation ki,n
has no second order nα terms for
1/2 ≤ α < 1, it is possible to derive the same regret rate
results that we prove later on for T RACE -UCB.
Equation (10) makes it explicit that the prediction error
comes from two different sources. The first one is the noise
in the measurements Y, whose impact is controlled by the
unknown variances σi2 ’s. Clearly, the larger the σi2 is, the
more observations are required to achieve the desired accuracy. At the same time, the diversity of contexts across
instances also impacts the overall prediction error. This is
very intuitive, since it would be a terrible idea for the research center discussed in the introduction to estimate the
parameters of a drug by providing the treatment only to a
hundred almost identical patients. We say contexts are balb i,n is well conditioned. Therefore, a good
anced when Σ
algorithm should take care of both aspects.
There are two extreme scenarios regarding the contributions of the two sources of error. 1) If the number of
contexts n is relatively large, since the context distribution is fixed, one can expect that contexts allocated to each
instance eventually become balanced (i.e., T RACE -UCB
does not bias the distribution of the contexts). In this case,
it is the difference in σi2 ’s that drives the number of times
each instance is selected. 2) When the dimension d or the
number of arms m is large w.r.t. n, balancing contexts becomes critical, and can play an important role in the final
prediction error, whereas the σi2 ’s are less relevant in this
scenario. While a learning algorithm cannot deliberately
choose a specific context (i.e., Xt is a random variable),
we may need to favor instances in which the contexts are
poorly balanced and their prediction error is large, despite
the fact that they might have small noise variances.
Algorithm. T RACE -UCB is designed as a combination of
the upper-confidence-bound strategy used in CH-AS (Carpentier et al., 2011) and the loss in (10), so as to obtain a
learning algorithm capable of allocating according to the
estimated variances and at the same time balancing the error generated by context mismatch. We recall that all the
quantities that are computed at every step of the algorithm
are indexed at the beginning and end of a step t by i, t − 1
2
(e.g., σ
bi,t−1
) and i, t (e.g., βbi,t ), respectively. At the end of
each step t, T RACE -UCB first computes an OLS estimate

βbi,t , and then use it to estimate the variance σ

to the optimal static allocation.

and then simply select the instance which maximizes this
score, i.e., It = arg maxi si,t−1 . Intuitively, T RACE -UCB
favors problems where the prediction error is potentially
large, either because of a large noise variance or because
of significant unbalance in the observed contexts w.r.t. the
target distribution with covariance Σ. A subtle but critical
aspect of T RACE -UCB is that by ignoring the current context Xt (but using all the past samples Xt−1 ) when choosing It , the distribution of the contexts allocated to each instance stays untouched and the second term in the score
b −1 ), naturally tends to d as more and
si,t−1 , i.e., Tr(ΣΣ

more (random) contexts are allocated to instance i. This is
shown by Proposition 4 whose proof is in Appendix C.2.
Proposition 4. Force the number of samples ki,t ≥ d + 1.

While Proposition 4 shows that the error term due to context mismatch tends to the constant d for all instances i as
the number of samples tends to infinity, when t is small
w.r.t. d and m, correcting for the context mismatch may
significantly improve the accuracy of the estimates βbi,n returned by the algorithm. Finally, note that while T RACE UCB uses OLS to compute estimates βbi,t , it computes its
returned parameters βbi,n by ridge regression (RLS) with
regularization parameter λ as

As we will discuss later, using RLS makes the algorithm
more robust and is crucial in obtaining regret bounds both
in expectation and high probability.

T RACE -UCB, we report an intermediate result (proof in

We now report our regret bound for the T RACE -UCB algorithm. The proof of Theorem 6 is in Appendix D.2.
Theorem 6. The regret of the Trace-UCB algorithm,
i.e., the difference between its loss and the loss of optimal
static allocation (see Eq. (8)), is upper-bounded by

Eq. (15) shows that the regret decreases as O(n−3/2 ) as expected. This is consistent with the context-free results (Antos et al., 2008; Carpentier et al., 2011), where the regret
decreases as n−3/2 , which is conjectured to be optimal.
However, it is important to note that in the contextual case,
the numerator also includes the dimensionality d. Thus,
when n  d, the regret will be small, and it will be larger
when n ≈ d. This motivates studying the high-dimensional
setting (App. F). Eq. (15) also indicates that the regret
depends on a problem-dependent constant 1/λmin , which
measures the complexity of the problem. Note that when

(16)

The only difference with the score used by T RACE -UCB
is the lack of the trace term in (12). Moreover, the regret
of this algorithm has similar rate in terms of n and d as
that of T RACE -UCB reported in Theorem 6. However, the
simulations of Sect. 4 show that the regret of VAR -UCB is
actually much higher than that of T RACE -UCB, specially
when dm is close to n. Intuitively, when n is close to dm,
balancing contexts becomes critical, and VAR -UCB suffers
because its score does not explicitly take them into account.
Sketch of the proof of Theorem 6. The proof is divided
into three parts. 1) We show that the behavior of the ridge
3

algorithms in Carpentier et al. (2011).

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

loss of T RACE -UCB is similar to that reported in Lemma 2
for algorithms that rely on OLS; see Lemma 19 in Ap2
pendix E. The independence of the β̂i,t and σ̂i,t
estimates
is again essential (see Remark 1). Although the loss of
T RACE -UCB depends on the ridge estimate of the paramλ
eters β̂i,n
, the decisions made by the algorithm at each
2
and obround only depend on the variance estimates σ̂i,t
served contexts. 2) We follow the ideas in Carpentier et al.
(2011) to lower-bound the total number of pulls ki,n for
each i ∈ [m] under a good event (see Theorem 5 and its
proof in Appendix D.1). 3) We finally use the ridge regularization to bound the impact of those cases outside the
good event, and combine everything in Appendix D.2.
The regret bound of Theorem 6 shows that the largest
expected loss across the problem instances incurred by
T RACE -UCB quickly approaches the loss of the optimal
static allocation algorithm (which knows the true noise
variances). While Ln (A) measures the worst expected loss,
at any specific realization of the algorithm, there may be
one of the instances which is very poorly estimated. As a
result, it would also be desirable to obtain guarantees for
the (random) maximum loss

term is, again, a n−3/2 deviation. However, in this case, the
guarantees hold simultaneously for all the instances.
Sketch of the proof of Theorem 7. In the proof we slightly
modify the confidence ellipsoids for the β̂i,t ’s, based
on self-normalized martingales, and derived in (AbbasiYadkori et al., 2011); see Thm. 13 in App. C. By means of
the confidence ellipsoids we control the loss in (17). Their
radiuses depend on the number of samples per instance, and
we rely on a high-probability events to compute a lower
bound on the number of samples. In addition, we need to
make sure the mean norm of the contexts will not be too
large (see Corollary 15 in App. C). Finally, we combine the
lower bound on ki,n with the confidence ellipsoids to conclude the desired high-probability guarantees in Thm. 7.
High-Dimensional Setting. High-dimensional linear models are quite common in practice, motivating the study of
the n < dm case, where the algorithms discussed so far

break down. We propose S PARSE -T RACE -UCB in Appendix F, an extension of T RACE -UCB that assumes and
takes advantage of joint sparsity across the linear functions.
The algorithm has two-stages: first, an approximate support is recovered, and then, T RACE -UCB is applied to the
induced lower dimensional space. We discuss and extend
our high-probability guarantees to S PARSE -T RACE -UCB
under suitable standard assumptions in Appendix F.

4. Simulations
In this section, we provide empirical evidence to support
our theoretical results. We consider both synthetic and realworld problems, and compare the performance (in terms of
normalized MSE) of T RACE -UCB to uniform sampling,
optimal static allocation (which requires the knowledge of
noise variances), and the context-free algorithm VAR -UCB
(see Remark 2). We do not compare to GFSP-MAX and
GAFS-MAX (Antos et al., 2008) since they are outperformed by CH-AS Carpentier et al. (2011) and VAR -UCB
is the same as CH-AS, except for the fact that we use the
concentration inequality in Prop. 3, since we are estimating
the variance from a regression problem using OLS.
First, we use synthetic data to ensure that all the assumptions of our model are satisfied, namely we deal with linear regression models with Gaussian context and noise.
We set the number of problem instances to m = 7 and
consider two scenarios: one in which all the noise variances are equal to 1 and one where they are not equal,
and σ 2 = (0.01, 0.02, 0.75, 1, 2, 2, 3). In the latter case,
2
2
σmax
/σmin
= 300. We study the impact of (independently)
increasing dimension d and horizon n on the performance,
while keeping all other parameters fixed. Second, we consider real-world datasets in which the underlying model is
non-linear and the contexts are not Gaussian, to observe
how T RACE -UCB behaves (relative to the baselines) in settings where its main underlying assumptions are violated.
Synthetic Data. In Figures 1(a,b), we display the results
for fixed horizon n = 350 and increasing dimension d.
For each value of d, we run 10, 000 simulations and report
the median of the maximum error across the instances for
each simulation. In Fig. 1(a), where σi2 ’s are equal, uniform
sampling and optimal static allocation execute the same allocation since there is no difference in the expected losses
of different instances. Nonetheless we notice that VAR UCB suffers from poor estimation as soon as d increases,
while T RACE -UCB is competitive with the optimal performance. This difference in performance can be explained
by the fact that VAR -UCB does not control for contextual
balance, which becomes a dominant factor in the loss of a
learning strategy for problems of high dimensionality. In
Fig. 1(b), in which σi2 ’s are different, uniform sampling is
no longer optimal but even in this case VAR -UCB performs

better than uniform sampling only for small d < 23, where
it is more important to control for the σi2 ’s. For larger dimensions, balancing uniformly the contexts eventually becomes a better strategy, and uniform sampling outperforms
VAR -UCB. In this case too, T RACE -UCB is competitive
with the optimal static allocation even for large d, successfully balancing both noise variance and contextual error.
Next, we study the performance of the algorithms w.r.t. n.
We report two different losses, one in expectation (3) and
one in high probability (17), corresponding to the results
we proved in Theorems 6 and 7, respectively. In order to
approximate the loss in (3) (Figures 1(c,d)) we run 30, 000
simulations, compute the average prediction error for each
instance i ∈ [m], and finally report the maximum mean error across the instances. On the other hand, we estimate the
loss in (17) (Figures 1(e,f)) by running 30, 000 simulations,
taking the maximum prediction error across the instances
for each simulation, and finally reporting their median.
In Figures 1(c, d), we display the loss for fixed dimension
d = 10 and horizon from n = 115 to 360. In Figure 1(c),
T RACE -UCB performs similarly to the optimal static allocation, whereas VAR -UCB performs significantly worse,

ranging from 25% to 50% higher errors than T RACE -UCB,
due to some catastrophic errors arising from unlucky contextual realizations for an instance. In Fig. 1(d), as the number of contexts grows, uniform sampling’s simple context
balancing approach is enough to perform as well as VAR UCB that again heavily suffers from large mistakes. In
both figures, T RACE -UCB smoothly learns the σi2 ’s and
outperforms uniform sampling and VAR -UCB. Its performance is comparable to that of the optimal static allocation,
especially in the case of equal variances in Fig. 1(c).
In Figure 1(e), T RACE -UCB learns and properly balances
observations extremely fast and obtains an almost optimal
performance. Similarly to figures 1(a,c), VAR -UCB struggles when variances σ̂i2 are almost equal, mainly because it
gets confused by random deviations in variance estimates
σ̂i2 , while overlooking potential and harmful context imbalances. Note that even when n = 360 (rightmost point), its
median error is still 25% higher than T RACE -UCB’s. In
Fig. 1(f), as expected, uniform sampling performs poorly,
due to mismatch in variances, and only outperforms VAR UCB for small horizons in which uniform allocation pays
off. On the other hand, T RACE -UCB is able to success-

fully handle the tradeoff between learning and allocating
according to variance estimates σ̂i2 , while accounting for
b i , even for very low n. We observe
the contextual trace Σ
that for large n, VAR -UCB eventually reaches the performance of the optimal static allocation and T RACE -UCB.
In practice the loss in (17) (figures 1(e,f)) is often more relevant than (3), since it is in high probability and not in expectation, and T RACE -UCB shows excellent performance
and robustness, regardless of the underlying variances σi2 .
Real Data. T RACE -UCB is based on assumptions such as
linearity, and Gaussianity of noise and context that may not
hold in practice, where data may show complex dependencies. Therefore, it is important to evaluate the algorithm
with real-world data to see its robustness to the violation
of its assumptions. We consider two collaborative filtering datasets in which users provide ratings for items. We
choose a dense subset of k users and p items, where every
user has rated every item. Thus, each user is represented
by a p-dimensional vector of ratings. We define the user
context by d out of her p ratings, and learn to predict her
remaining m = p − d ratings (each one is a problem instance). All item ratings are first centered, so each item’s
mean is zero. In each simulation, n out of the k users are selected at random to be fed to the algorithm, also in random
order. Algorithms can select any instance as the dataset
contains the ratings of every instance for all the users. At
the end of each simulation, we compute the prediction error
for each instance by using the k − n users that did not participate in training for that simulation. Finally, we report
the median error across all simulations.
Fig. 2(a) reports the results using the Jester Dataset
by (Goldberg et al., 2001) that consists of joke ratings in
a continuous scale from −10 to 10. We take d = 40 joke
ratings as context and learn the ratings for another 9 jokes.
In addition, we add another function that counts the total
number of movies originally rated by the user. The latter
is also centered, bounded to the same scale, and has higher
variance (without conditioning on X). The number of to-

tal users is k = 3811, and m = 10. When the number
of observations is limited, the advantage of T RACE -UCB
is quite significant (the improvement w.r.t. uniform allocation goes from 45% to almost 20% for large n, while w.r.t.
VAR -UCB it goes from almost 30% to roughly 5%), even
though the model and context distribution are far from linear and Gaussian, respectively.
Fig. 2(b) shows the results for the MovieLens
dataset (Maxwell Harper & Konstan, 2016) that consists of movie ratings between 0 and 5 with 0.5 increments.
We select 30 popular movies rated by k = 1363 users,
and randomly choose m = 5 of them to learn (so
d = 25). In this case, all problems have similar variance
2
2
/σ̂min
≈ 1.3) so uniform allocation seems appropri(σ̂max
ate. Both T RACE -UCB and VAR -UCB modestly improve
uniform allocation, while their performance is similar.

5. Conclusions
We studied the problem of adaptive allocation of n contextual samples of dimension d to estimate m linear functions equally well, under heterogenous noise levels σi2
that depend on the linear instance and are unknown to
the decision-maker. We proposed T RACE -UCB, an optimistic algorithm that successfully solves the explorationexploitation dilemma by simultaneously learning the σi2 ’s,
allocating samples accordingly to their estimates, and balancing the contextual information across the instances. We
also provide strong theoretical guarantees for two losses of
interest: in expectation and high-probability. Simulations
were conducted in several settings, with both synthetic and
real data. The favorable results suggest that T RACE -UCB
is reliable, and remarkably robust even in settings that fall
outside its assumptions, thus, a useful and simple tool to
implement in practice.

B. Loss of an OLS-based Learning Algorithm (Proof of Lemma 2)
Unlike in the proof of Proposition 1, when the number of pulls is random and depends on the value of the previous
observations (through Dn ), then in general, the OLS estimates βbi,n are no longer distributed as Eq. 21 and the derivation
for Astat no longer holds. In fact, for a learning algorithm, the value ki,t itself provides some information about the
observations that have been obtained up until time t and were used by the algorithm to determine ki,t . In the following, we
show that by ignoring the current context Xt when choosing instance It , we are still able to analyze the loss of T RACE UCB and obtain a result very similar to the static case.
We first need two auxiliary lemmas (Lemmas 8 and 9), one on the computation of an empirical estimate of the variance of
the noise, and an independence result between the variance estimate and the linear regression estimate.
Lemma 8. In any linear regression problem with noise  ∼ N (0, σ 2 ), after t ≥ d + 1 samples, given an OLS estimator

U = t+1 − Xt+1

V = β̂t+1 − β | Gt .

We want to show that the random vectors U ∈ R and V ∈ R are independent. We first recall that the noise t+1 | Gt ∼
N (0, σ 2 ), and it is independent of 1 , . . . , t , and β̂t under Gt . Furthermore, by the induction assumption β̂t | Gt is also
Gaussian, so we have that (β̂t , t+1 ) are jointly Gaussian given Gt . Then we can conveniently rewrite U as
T
U = (−Xt+1 , 1)T (β̂t , t+1 ) + Xt+1

which shows that it is a Gaussian vector. Using the recursive formulation in Eq. 29 we can also rewrite V as

we need to show that E[U V | Gt ] = 0 to prove that U and V are uncorrelated

Now we can prove Lemma 2:
Lemma. Let A be a learning algorithm that selects instances It as a function of the previous history, that is, Dt−1 =
{X1 , I1 , YI1 ,1 , . . . , Xt−1 , It−1 , YIt−1 ,t−1 } and computes estimates βbi,n using OLS. Then, its loss after n steps can be
expressed as

where ki,n =

b i,n = XT Xi,n /ki,n .
I{It = i} and Σ

Proof. For any instance i, we can assume that the following random variables are sampled before T RACE -UCB starts
collecting observations (we omit the i index in the table):
t=1

As a result, we can interpret T RACE -UCB as controlling the stopping time ti = ki,n for each problem i, that is, the total
number of samples ki,n , leading to the final estimates β̂ti and σ̂t2i . In the following we introduce the notation X1:j as the
sample matrix constructed from exactly j samples, unlike Xi,n which is the sample matrix obtained with ki,n . So we have
X1:ki,n = Xi,n . Crucially, when the errors j are Gaussian, then β̂j | X1:j and σ̂j2 | X1:j are independent for any fixed j
(note these random variables have nothing to do with the algorithm’s decisions).
Let Fj be the σ-algebra generated by X1 , . . . , Xn and σ̂12 , . . . , σ̂j2 . We recall that from Lemma 9
T
βbj |X1:j = β̂j | Fj ∼ N (βj , σ 2 (X1:j
X1:j )−1 ).

(31)

Intuitively, this results says that, given the data X1:n , if we are additionally given all the estimates for the variance {σ̂s2 }js=2
—which obviously depend on 1 , . . . , j —, then the updated distribution for β̂j does not change at all. This is a crucial
property since T RACE -UCB ignores the current context Xt and it makes decisions only based on previous contexts and
the variance estimates {σ̂s2 }js=2 , thus allowing us to proceed and do inference on β̂j as in the fixed allocation case.

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

We now need to take into consideration the filtration Fi,j for a specific instance i and the environment filtration E−i
containing all the contexts X and noise  from all other instances (different from i). Since the environment filtration E−i is
independent from the samples from instance i, then we can still apply Lemma 9 and obtain
βbi,j | Fi,j , E−i ∼ βbi,j | Fi,j .

C. Concentration Inequalities (Proofs of Propositions 3 and 4)
In the next two subsections, we prove Propositions 3 and 4, respectively. In addition, we also show a confidence ellipsoid
result for the βb estimates, and a concentration inequality for the norm of the observations Xt .
C.1. Concentration Inequality for the Variance (Proof of Proposition 3)

Proof. First note that the distribution of σ̂t2 conditioned on Xt follows the scaled chi-squared distribution, i.e.,
σ̂t2 | X ∼

χ2 .
t − d t−d

Also note that the distribution of the estimate does not depend on Xt and we can integrate out the randomness in Xt . In
order to show concentration around the mean, we directly use the sub-exponential properties of σ̂t2 . The χ2k distribution is
sub-exponential with parameters (4k, 4).4 Furthermore, we know that for any constant C > 0, Cχ2k is (4C 2 k, 4C)-subexponential. As a result, we have that σ̂t2 is subexponential with parameters

C.2. Concentration Inequality for the Trace (Proof of Proposition 4)
We first recall some basic definitions. For any matrix A ∈ Rn×d , the i-th singular value si (A) is equivalent to si (A)2 =
λi (AT A), where λi is the i-th eigenvalue. The smallest and largest singular values smin and smax satisfy
smin kxk2 ≤ kAxk2 ≤ smax kxk2

for all x ∈ Rd .

The extreme singular values measure the maximum and minimum distortion of points and their distance when going from
Rd to Rn via the linear operator A. We also recall that the spectral norm of A is given by
kAk = sup
x∈Rd \0

kAxk2
= sup kAxk2 ,
kxk2
x∈S n−1

and thus, smax (A) = kAk and smin (A) = 1/kA−1 k, if A is invertible.
We report the following concentration inequality for the eigenvalues of random Gaussian matrices.

(60)

e n (A) is a random variable as β̂i,n is random, and the expectation is only taken with respect to the test point

Proof. We define a set of events that help us control the loss, and then we show that these events simultaneously hold with
high probability. In particular, we need the following events:
2
1. EG ≡ the good event holds (for all arms i, and all times t), which includes a confidence interval for σ̂i,t
and the trace
of the empirical covariance matrix.

Holds with probability 1 − δG . This event is described and controlled in Proposition 3 and Proposition 4.
2. EM,i ≡ the confidence intervals Ci,t created for arm i at time t contain the true βi at all times t —based on the
vector-valued martingale in (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011).
Holds with probability 1 − δM,i . This event is described and controlled in Theorem 13.
3. EC,i,t ≡ the empirical covariance Σ̂i,t for arm i at time t is close to Σ. This event is a direct consequence of event EG .
4. EB,i,t ≡ the first t observations pulled at arm i have norm reasonably bounded. The empirical average norm is not too
far from its mean. Holds with probability 1 − δB,i,t . This event is described and controlled in Corollary 15.
Let H be the set of all the previous events. Then, by the union bound
X
P (∩∈H ) ≥ 1 −
δ .

(63)

∈H

e n (A) = maxi∈[m] kβi − β̂i,n k2 is upper bounded by a quantity
Our goal is to show that if ∩∈H  holds, then the loss L
Σ
that resembles the expected loss of the algorithm that knows the σi2 ’s in advance.
P
Fix δ >
P0. We want δ = ∈H δ , and we would like to assign equal weight to all the sets of events. First, δG = δ/3.
Also,
P
P i δM,i = δ/3, implying δM,i = δ/3m for every arm i ∈ [m]. Finally, to bound observation norms, we set
i
t δB,i,t = δ/3. It follows that we can take δB,i,t = δ/3mT , even though t really ranges from d to n.
Assume that EG , EM,i and EB,i,t hold for all arms i and times t. Then, by Theorem 5, the final number of pulls for arm i
can be lower bounded by

where c = 2 1 + 2 log(12mn/δ)/d .
For notational simplicity, we denote by β̂i,t the estimate after t pulls. Thus, with respect to our previous notation where
β̂i,n referred to our final estimate, we have that β̂i,ki,n = β̂i,n as ki,n is the total number of pulls for arm i.
If the EM,i events hold, then we know that our β̂i,t estimates are not very far from the true values βi when t is large. In
particular, we know that the error is controlled by the radius Ri,t of the confidence ellipsoids. We expect these radiuses to
decrease with the number of observations per arm, t. As we have a lower bound on the total number of pulls for arm i, ki,n ,
if the confidence ellipsoids apply, then we can directly obtain an upper bound on the radius Ri,t at the end of the process.
We need to do a bit of work to properly bound kβ̂i,ki,n − βi k2Σ .
Fix arm i, and assume EM,i holds. In addition, assume kβi k2 ≤ Z for all i. Let V̄i,t = λI + XTi,t Xi,t , where Xi,t contains
the first t observations pulled by arm i. We modify the proof of Theorem 2 in (Abbasi-Yadkori et al., 2011) by taking
x = (V̂t /t)(β̂t − β∗ ) in their equation 5 (we are using their notation in the latter expression). Assume the algorithm pulls
arm i a total of t times —ki,n is a stopping time with respect to the σ-algebra that includes the environment (other arms)—

E. Loss of a RLS-based Learning Algorithm
E.1. Distribution of RLS estimates
Proposition 16. Given a linear regression problem with observations Y = X T β +  with Gaussian noise with variance
σ 2 , after n contexts X and the corresponding observations Y, the ridge estimate of parameter λ is obtained as
β̂ λ = (XT X + λI)−1 XT Y = WXT Y,
with W = (XT X + λI)−1 , and its distribution conditioned on X is

β̂ λ | X ∼ N β − λWβ, σ 2 W(XT X)WT .

(95)

Proof. Recalling the definition of the OLS estimator βb (assuming it exists), we can easily rewrite the RLS estimator as
b
β̂ λ = (XT X + λI)−1 (XT X)(XT X)−1 XT Y = (XT X + λI)−1 (XT X)β.
b We just need to compute the correThis immediately gives that the conditional distribution of β̂ λ is Gaussian as for β.
sponding mean vector and the covariance matrix. We first notice that the RLS estimator is biased as

E[β̂ λ X] = (XT X + λI)−1 (XT X)β.
Let S = XT X, then we can further rewrite the bias as

= (I + λS−1 )−1 β = I − λ(S + λI)−1 β

where we used the matrix inversion lemma. Recalling that the covariance of βb is σ 2 (XT X)−1 , the covariance of βbλ is then
h
i

i
Cov β̂ λ |X = W(XT X)Cov β̂|X (XT X)WT = σ 2 W(XT X)WT .

E.2. Loss Function of a RLS-based Algorithm
We start by proving the loss function in the case of a static algorithm.
Lemma 17. Let A be a learning algorithm that selects instance i for ki,n times, where ki,n is a fixed quantity chosen in
advance, and that returns estimates βbiλ obtained by RLS with regularization λ. Then its loss after n steps can be expressed
as

where Wi,n =

, and Xni is the matrix with the ki,n contexts from instance i.

Proof. The proof follows the same steps as in App. A up to Eq. 22, where we have


 i
Ln (Astat ) = max Tr EXi Ei Σ(βi − β̂i )(βi − β̂i )T Xi

= E (β̂ − β + λWβ − λWβ)(β̂ − β + λWβ − λWβ)T | X

= σ 2 W(XT X)WT + λ2 Wββ T WT


= W σ 2 XT X + λ2 ββ T WT .

Active Learning for Accurate Estimation of Linear Models

Plugging the final expression back into Ln (Astatic ) we obtain the desired expression.
We notice that a result similar to Lemma 9 holds for RLS estimates as well.
Proposition 18. Assume the noise  is Gaussian. Let σ̂ 2 be the estimate for σ 2 computed by using the residuals of the OLS
solution β̂. Then, β̂ λ and σ̂ 2 are independent random variable conditionally to X.
Proof. As shown in the proof of Proposition 16, we have β̂ λ = (XT X + λI)−1 (XT X)βb and we know that functions of
independent random variables are themselves independent. Since the matrix mapping βb to βbλ is fixed given X, and β̂ and
σ̂ 2 are conditionally independent from Lemma 9, then the statement follows.
We can now combine Proposition 18 and Lemma 17 to conclude that a similar expression to Eq. 97 holds for the ridge
estimators also when a non-static algorithm such as T RACE -UCB is run.
Lemma 19. Let A be a learning algorithm such that It is chosen as a function of Dt−1
=
{X1 , I1 , YI1 ,1 , . . . , Xt−1 , It−1 , YIt−1 ,t−1 }, and that it returns estimates βbiλ obtained by RLS with regularization λ.
Then its loss after n steps can be expressed as

2
Proof. The proof follows immediately by extending Lemma 9 to β̂λ as, by Proposition 18, β̂λ and σ̂OLS
are independent.
Then, we proceed in a way similar to that in the proof of Lemma 2 to perform the required conditioning.

F. Sparse Trace-UCB Algorithm
F.1. Summary
High-dimensional linear regression models are remarkably common in practice. Companies tend to record a large number
of features of their customers, and feed them to their prediction models. There are also cases in which the number of problem instances under consideration m is large, e.g., too many courses in the MOOC example described in the introduction.
Unless the horizon n is still proportionally large w.r.t. md, these scenarios require special attention. In particular, algorithms like T RACE -UCB that adaptively use contexts in their allocation strategy become more robust than their context-free
counterparts.
A natural assumption in such scenarios is sparsity, i.e., only a small subset of features are relevant to the prediction
problem at hand (have non-zero coefficient). In our setting of m problem instances, it is often reasonable to assume that
these instances are related to each other, and thus, it makes sense to extend the concept of sparsity to joint sparsity, i.e., a
sparsity pattern across the instances. Formally, we assume that there exists a s  d such that
∆

|S| = | ∪i∈[m] supp(βi )| = s,

(98)

(j)

where supp(βi ) = {j ∈ [d] : βi 6= 0} denotes the support of the i’th problem instance. A special case of joint sparsity is
when |supp(βi )| ≈ s, for all i, i.e., most of the relevant features are shared across the instances.
In this section, we focus on the scenario where dm > n. When we can only allocate a small (relative to d) number of
contexts to each problem instance, proper balancing of contexts becomes extremely important, and thus, the algorithms
that do not take into account context in their allocation are destined to fail. Although T RACE -UCB has the advantage of
using context in its allocation strategy, it still needs to quickly discover the relevant features (those in the support) and only
use those in its allocation strategy.
This motivates a two-stage algorithm, we call it S PARSE -T RACE -UCB, whose pseudocode is in Algorithm 2. In the first
stage, the algorithm allocates contexts uniformly to all the instances, L contexts per instance, and then recovers the support.

In the second stage, it relies on the discovered support S,

discovered, i.e., Sb = S.
There exists a large literature on how to perform simultaneous support discovery in jointly sparse linear regression problems (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011; Obozinski et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2013), which we discuss in detail below.
Most of these algorithms minimize the regularized empirical loss
min

M∈Rd×m

m

kYi − Xi M[, i]k2 + λ kMk,
k i=1

where k is the number of samples per problem, M be the matrix whose i’th column is M[, i] = β̂i , Xi ∈ Rk×d , and
Yi = Xi βi + i . In particular, they use la /lb block regularization norm, i.e., kMkla /lb = kvkla , where vi = kM[i, ]klb
and M[i, ] is the i’th row of M. In short, the S PARSE -T RACE -UCB algorithm uses the l1 /l2 block regularization Lasso
algorithm (Wang et al., 2013), an extension of the algorithm in (Obozinski et al., 2011), for its support discovery stage.
We extend the guarantees of Theorem 7 to the high dimensional case with joint sparsity, assuming s is known.
The following is the main result of this section:
Theorem 20. Let δ1 > 0. Assume kβi k2 ≤ Z for all i, for some Z > 0, and assume the parameters (n, d, s, βi , Σ) satisfy
conditions C1 to C5 in (Wang et al., 2013). Let ψ be the sparsity overlap function defined in (Obozinski et al., 2011). If

The exact technical assumptions and the proof are given and discussed in below. We simply combine the high-probability
results of Theorem 7, and the high-probability support recovery of Theorem 2 in (Wang et al., 2013).
In addition, we provide Corollary 21, where we study the regime of interest where the support overlap is complete (for
simplicity), n = C1 ms log d  md for C1 > 0, and L = C2 s log d, for C1 − C2 > 0.
Corollary 21. Under the assumptions of Theorem 20, let δ1 > 0, assume n = C1 ms log d, the support of all arms are

Given our pure exploration perspective, it is obviously more efficient to learn the true supports as soon as possible. That
way we can adjust our behavior by collecting the right data based on our initial findings. Note that this is not always the
case; for example, if the total number of pulls is unknown. Then it is not clear what is the right amount of budget to invest
upfront to recover the supports (see tracking algorithms and doubling trick).
We briefly describe Algorithm 2 in words. First, in the recovery stage we sequentially pull all arms a number of times,
say L times. We do not take into account the context, and just apply a round robin technique to pull each arm exactly L
times. In total, there are exactly s components that are non-zero for at least one arm (out of d). After the Lm pulls, we
use a block-regularized Lasso algorithm to recover the joint sparsity pattern. We discuss some of the alternatives later. The
outcome of this stage is a common support Sb := ∪i supp(β̂i ). With high probability we recover the true support Sb = S. In
the second stage, or pure exploration stage, the original T RACE -UCB algorithm is applied. The T RACE -UCB algorithm
works by computing an estimate σ̂i2 at each step t for each arm i. Then, it pulls the arm maximizing the score

The key observation is that in the second stage we only consider the components of each context that are in S.
OLS
2
we start by pulling s + 1 times each arm so that we can compute the initial OLS estimates β̂i and σ̂i . We keep updating
those estimates when an arm is pulled, and the trace is computed with respect to the components in Sb only.
Finally, we return the Ridge estimates based only on the data collected in the second stage.
F.2. A note on the Static Allocation
WhatP
is the optimal static performance in this setting if the σ 2 ’s are known? For simplicity, suppose we pull arm i exactly
2
(σi / j σj2 ) n times. We are interested in Lasso guarantees for kX T (β̂i − βi )k22 . Note in this case we can actually set λi
as a function of σi2 as required in most Lasso analyses, because σi2 is known.
A common guarantee is as follows (see (Hastie et al., 2015; Raskutti et al., 2010)). With high probability
kβ̂i − βi k22 ≤

c2 σi2 τ s log d
,
γ2
k

where k is the number of observations, d the ambient dimension, s the efficient dimension, γ is the restricted eigenvalues
constant for Σ, τ > 2 is the parameter that tunes the probability bound, and c is a universal constant.
P
Thus, if we set k = (σi2 / j σj2 ) n, then we obtain that whp

Note that the latter event is independent across different i ∈ [m], so all of them simultaneously hold with high probability.
The term γ −2 was expected as depending on the correlation levels in Σ the problem can be easier or harder. In addition,
note that as kβ̂i − βi k2Σ = Tr(Σ(β̂i − βi )(β̂i − βi )T ), we have that
λmin (Σ) kβ̂i − βi k22 ≤ kβ̂i − βi k2Σ ≤ λmax (Σ)kβ̂i − βi k22 .

F.3. Simultaneous Support Recovery
There has been a large amount of research on how to perform simultaneous support recovery in sparse settings for multiple
regressions. Let M be the matrix whose i-th column is M(i) = βi .
A common objective function after k observations per problem is
min
M̄∈Rd×m

m
1X
kYj − Xj M̄(j) k2 + λ kM̄k,
k j=1

(103)

where we assumed Yj = Xj βj + j , and Xj ∈ Rk×d , Yj , j ∈ Rk and βj ∈ Rd .
The la /lb block regularization norm is
kM̄kla /lb = kvka ,

where vj = kM̄j kb

M̄j is the j-th row of M̄.

(104)

There are a few differences among the most popular pieces of work.
Negahban and Wainwright (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011) consider random Gaussian designs Xj ∼ N (0, Σj ) with
random Gaussian noise (and common variance). The regularization norm is l1 /l∞ . In words, they take the sum of the
absolute values of the maximum element per row in M̄. This forces sparsity (via the l1 norm), but once a row is selected
there is no penalty in increasing the β̄ components up to the current maximum of the row. They tune λ as in the standard
analysis of Lasso, that is, proportionally to σ 2 , which is unknown in our case. Results are non-asymptotic, and recovery
happens with high probability when the number of observations is k > Cs(m + log d). They show that if the overlap is not
large enough (2/3 of the support, for m = 2 regression problems), then running independent Lasso estimates has higher
statistical efficiency. We can actually directly use the results in (Negahban & Wainwright, 2011) if we assume an upper
2
bound σmax
≤ R is known.

Obozinski, Wainwright and Jordan (Obozinski et al., 2011) use l1 /l2 block regularization (aka Multivariate Group Lasso).
Their design is random Gaussian, but it is fixed across regressions: Xj = X. They provide asymptotic guarantees under the
scaling k, d, s → ∞, d − s → ∞, and standard assumptions like bounded Σ-eigenspectrum, the irrepresentable condition,
and self-incoherence. The first condition is not only required for support recovery, but also for l2 consistency. The last two
conditions are not required for risk consistency, while essential for support recovery. To capture the amount of non-zero
pattern overlap among regressions, they define the sparsity overlap function ψ, and their sample requirements are a function
of ψ. In particular, one needs k > C ψ log(d − s), where the constant C depends on quantities related to the covariance
matrix of the design matrices, and ψ can be equal to s/m, if all the patterns overlap, and at most s if they are disjoint.
Their theorems use a sequence of regularization parameters
r
f (d) log d
,
where f (d) → ∞ as d → ∞,
λk =
k
in such a way that λk → 0 as k, d → ∞. Finally, k > 2s is also required. They also provide a two-stage algorithm for
efficient estimation of individual supports for each regression problem. All these optimization problems are convex, and
can be efficiently solved in general.
To overcome the issue of common designs (we do not pull each context several times), we use the results by Wang, Liang,
and Xing in (Wang et al., 2013). They extend the guarantees in (Obozinski et al., 2011) to the case where the design
matrices are independently sampled for each regression problem. In order to formally present their result, we describe
some assumptions. Let Σ(i) be the covariance matrix for the design observations of the i-th regression (in our case, they
are all equal to Σ), and S the union of the sparse supports across regressions.

then the l1 /l2 regularized problem given in (103) has a unique solution M̂, the support union supp(M̂) equals the true
support S, and kM̂ − Mkl∞ /l2 = o(b∗min ), with probability greater than
1 − m exp(−c0 log s) − exp(−c1 log(d − s)),

(110)

where c0 and c1 are constants.

For our purposes, there is a single Σ, which implies that we can remove the max expressions in C1 and C3. Corollary
2 in (Wang et al., 2013) establishes that when supports are equal for all arms, the number of samples required per arm is
reduced by a factor of m.
F.4. High-Dimensional Trace-UCB Guarantees

Now we show our main result for high-dimensional Trace-UCB, Theorem 20.
Theorem. Let δ1 > 0. Assume kβi k2 ≤ Z for all i, for some Z > 0, and assume the parameters (n, d, s, βi , Σ) satisfy

Proof. We start by assuming the recovered support Ŝ is equal to the true support S. This event, say ES , holds with
probability at least 1 − δ2 by Theorem 22 when L satisfies (112).
Then, we fix δ1 > 0, and run the second stage applying the Trace-UCB algorithm in the s-dimensional space given by the
components in Ŝ.
By Theorem 7, if n − Lm ≥ (s + 1)m, then, with probability at least 1 − δ1 , the following holds:

to their true value. Hence L
We conclude that (114) holds with probability at least 1 − δ1 − δ2 .
One regime of interest is when n = C1 ms log d  md. In addition, let us assume complete support overlap across arms,
so ψ = s/Cm. Then, we set the number of initial pulls per arm to be L = C2 s log d, with C1 > C2 .
In this case, we have that Corollary 21 holds.
